<p style="text-align: right;"><em>translation from English </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Bikku Brahmali versions</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>from- <a href="https://vk.com/samano">Kheminda Samanera</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 20px;">Respect to the teacher, perfect, fully awakened</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The origin of the monastic code</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Once upon a time, Buddha, the Teacher, was in the Veranga next to the Naleria Nimba Tree, with the great Sangha of five hundred monks. Then the Brahmin in Verange heard</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“The lord, the hermit Gotama, the Saki, who has gone forward (to a homeless life) from the Sakya clan, resides in Verange next to the Naleria Nimba tree with the great Sangha of five hundred monks. That teacher Gotama gained a good reputation as follows:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“He is truly an arahant, fully awakened, perfect in true knowledge and behavior, fortunate, a knower of the worlds, an unsurpassed tamer of people capable of taming, a teacher of gods and people, an awakened one, a teacher . Having comprehended by his own direct knowledge this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this generation with its hermits and Brahmins, its gods and men, he made it known to others. He taught the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end, with the correct meaning and expression: he revealed a completely complete and pure spiritual life.. It is truly good to see such arahants.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Then Brahmin Veranja arrived at the teacher, exchanged friendly greetings with him and sat down on one side. Then he told the teacher the following:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“I heard the good Gotama that the hermit Gotama does not show respect to Brahmins who are worn out, old, burdened with years, successful in life, who have come to the last stage; He neither stands up for them nor offers them seats. This good Gotama is not correct.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Brahmin, in the world with his gods, the lords of death and supreme beings, in this generation, with his hermits and Brahmins, his gods and people, I do not see the one to whom I must show respect to whom I must stand before, or to whom I must offer a seat. If the Tathagata pays respect to someone, stands in front of him or offers him a seat, his head may even split into pieces.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama has no taste.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Indeed a Brahmin, the way anyone could truly say about me, “the hermit Gotama has no taste.” Tasting for forms, sounds, smells, aromas and tangible objects, they were destroyed by the Tathagata, cut off at the roots, made like the stump of a palm tree, thus completely done away with, they are unable to arise in the future. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The Hermit Gotama has no taste.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama without pleasure.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Indeed a Brahmin, the way in which anyone could truly say of me, “the hermit Gotama without pleasure.” The pleasures of forms, sounds, smells, aromas and tangible objects, they were destroyed by the Tathagata, cut off at the roots, made like a palm stump, thus completely done away with, they are not capable of arising in the future. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The Hermit Gotama without pleasure.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama professes the doctrine of inaction.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">““Indeed a Brahmin, the way in which anyone could truly say about me,” the hermit Gotama professes the doctrine of inaction.” Because I teach not to act badly in body, speech and mind. I teach not to do various bad, bad, unwholesome actions. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The hermit Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“The Venerable Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.”</span><br>
<span stylee="font-size: 20px;">““Indeed a Brahmin, the way in which anyone could truly say of me,” the hermit Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.” Because I am talking about the annihilation of sensual desire, anger and agitation. I'm talking about the annihilation of various bad, unwholesome qualities. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The Hermit Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama is the one who is disgusted.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">““Indeed, a Brahmin, the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “the hermit Gotama is the one who abhors.” Because I abhor misbehavior in body, speech and mind and acquisition. I'm talking about the annihilation of various bad, unwholesome qualities. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The hermit Gotama is the one who abhors.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama Restrainer.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">““Indeed a Brahmin, the way in which anyone could truly say about me is “the hermit Gotama the restrainer.” Since I teach the Dhamma to control sensual desires, anger and agitation; I teach Dhamma to control various bad, unwholesome qualities. This is the way that anyone could truly say about me, “The Hermit Gotama the Restrainer.” But that's not what you meant.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable Gotama is one who practices asceticism.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">““Indeed, a Brahmin, the way anyone could truly say about me, “the hermit Gotama practices austerity.” Because I say that bad, unwholesome qualities - bad behavior in body, speech and mind - must be burned away. The one who has destroyed the bad, unwholesome qualities that were burned, who has uprooted them, made them like the stump of a palm tree, done away with them, absolutely to the point that they cannot arise in the future - that one I call the one who practices asceticism. The Tathagata has discarded the bad, unwholesome qualities that must be killed, uprooted them, made them like a palm tree, done away with them absolutely so much that they are unable to arise in the future. This is the way in which anyone could truly say about me, “The hermit Gotama is one who practices austerity.” But that's not what you meant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Brahmin, suppose there is a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which is properly covered, properly warmed and properly incubated, she is the first chicken to hatch safely - after piercing the eggshell with a claw or beak. Is she called the oldest or the youngest? »</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“She should be called the eldest, because she is the oldest of them.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Just like that, in this generation, not understanding, shrouded like an egg, I alone in the world cracked the eggshell of ignorance and achieved an unrivaled complete awakening. I, a Brahmin, am the oldest and best in the world.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">I was firm and energetic and had clarity of awareness; My body was calm and my mind was one. Completely detached from the five senses, secluded from unwholesome mental qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which consists of the joy and bliss born of solitude and is accompanied by the movement of the mind. Through stilling the movement of the mind I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has an inner certainty and unification of the mind and consists of joy and bliss born from stillness. Through the extinction of joy, I remained calm, attentive and clearly aware, experiencing bliss directly, and I entered and remained in the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of: “One is calm, attentive and abides in bliss.” Through the abandonment of bliss and suffering and the former cessation of joy and aversion, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of awareness and tranquility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then, when my mind was collected, purified, pure, spotless, free from defilements, gentle, obedient, steady and equanimous, I directed it towards the knowledge that is memories of previous lives. I remembered many past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births and many aeons the disintegration of the world, many eons of unfolding of the world and many eons of both decay and unfolding, and I knew: “I had such a name, such a family, such an appearance, such food, such an experience of happiness and suffering and such a path in life. Dying there, I was reborn in another place, and there I had such a name, such a family, thatsuch appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering and such life. Dying there, I was reborn here." In this way, I remembered many past lives with their characteristics and characteristics. This was the first true understanding I achieved in the first hours of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains attentive, energetic and diligent.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">This, Brahmin, was my first break, like a chicken from an eggshell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then, when my mind was collected, purified, cleansed, spotless, free from defilements, gentle, obedient, steady and equanimous, I directed it towards the knowledge of origin and death creatures.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">With the purified divine eye that surpasses man, I have seen beings dying and reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, go to good places and bad places, and I understood how beings leave according to their actions: “These beings who misbehaved&nbsp; body, speech and mind that offended noble people who held the wrong view and acted accordingly, with the destruction of the body, after death, reborn in a lower realm, a bad destiny, a world of suffering, hell. But these beings who were engaged in good behavior by body, speech and mind, who did not offend the noble ones, who held the right view and acted accordingly, at the death of the body after death, were reborn in a good place, the heavenly world.” Thus, with the purified divine eye, superior to the human, I saw beings die and be born, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, go to good places and bad places, and I understood how beings follow their actions. This was the second true understanding I achieved in the middle hours of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains alert, energetic and diligent. This, Brahmin, was my second break, like a chicken from an eggshell.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Then, when my mind was collected, purified, pure, spotless, free from defilements, gentle, obedient, steady and equanimous, I directed it towards the knowledge of the cessation of defilements. I have known according to reality: “This is suffering.” This is the source of suffering. "This is the end of suffering." “This is the path that leads to the end of suffering.” I realized that according to reality: “This is pollution; “This is the source of pollution,” “This is the end of pollution.” “This is the path leading to the end of pollution.” When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sensual pleasure, from the corruption of existence, from the corruption of views and from the corruption of ignorance. When he was released, I knew that he was liberated, and I realized that the birth had come to an end, the spiritual life had been lived, the work had been done, there would be no more existence [after death]. This was the third true understanding I achieved in the third hour of the night. Ignorance was dispelled and understanding arose, darkness was dispelled and light arose, as happens to one who remains alert, energetic and diligent.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">This, Brahmin, was my third plucking, like a chicken from an eggshell.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Then the Brahmin told the Teacher,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Okay Gotama is the eldest; Okay Gotama is the best! Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful! Just as someone has either set up what was overturned, or revealed what was hidden, or shown the way to someone who was lost, or brought a lamp into the darkness so that someone with eyes can see what is there,< /span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">So you have made the teaching understandable in many respects. Good Gotama, I take refuge in you, in your teaching and in the order of monks. Please accept me as a follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please agree to spend the rainy season in Verange with the Order of Monks. The teacher silently agreed and the Brahmin understood. Then he stood up from his seat, bowed to the teacher, walked around him to his right and left.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">At that time, there was not enough food in Veranja and she was struck by hunger, the harvest was spoiled and turned into straw. It was not easy to get anything by begging. At that time, some horse traders from Uttarapata stayed for the monsoon season in Verange with five hundred horses. At the horse farm they prepared many portions of steamed grain for the monks.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Having dressed in the morning, the monks took their bowls and clothes and entered Veranja for alms. Unable to get anything, they went to the stables. Then they brought a portion of steamed grains to the monastery, crushedthey were eaten. Venerable Ananda crushed some of the steamed grain on a stone, took it to the teacher, and the teacher ate it. The teacher heard the sound of a mortar. Buddhas sometimes ask knowingly, and sometimes knowingly do not ask; They ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when&nbsp; unwholesome; Regarding that which is unwholesome, the Buddhas destroyed the bridge. Buddhas ask a question to monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to establish a rule of teaching.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">So the Teacher asked Ananda: “Ananda, what is that sound of the mortar?” - Ananda told the Teacher.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Okay, okay, Ananda, you excellent people have conquered the problem of hunger; Later generations will despise even rice and meat.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then Venerable Mahamogalanna arrived at the teacher, bowed to him, and sat down on one side</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Then he said:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Currently Venerable, Verange is short of food and is stricken with famine with the crops spoiled and reduced to straw. It is not easy to obtain dana through alms. Venerable One, beneath the surface of this great land there is an abundance of food that tastes like the taste of pure honey. It would be nice if I could turn the earth over so that the monks could enjoy eating these aquatic plants.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">But what will you do with those creatures that live there Moggallan?</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“I will make one of my arms wide, like a great earth, and send these creatures to it. And I will send these creatures there. Then, on the other hand, I will turn the earth over. Then with the other hand, I will turn the earth over.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Please don't turn the earth over, Moggallana. These creatures may lose their minds.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“In that case, Venerable One, it would be good if the entire Order of monks could go to Uttarakura for dana.”</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">"No, Moggallana, please don't pursue this."</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">At that time, Venerable Sariputta was in seclusion, he thought, “For which Buddhas, the Dhamma did not last long? Which Buddhas had a long Dhamma?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">In the evening, after leaving solitude, Sariputta arrived to the Master. He bowed to him, sat down on one side, and said, “Right now, Venerable One, when I was in solitude, I thought, “Which Buddhas did not have Dhamma for a long time? Which Buddhas had a long Dhamma?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Sariputta, the Dhamma established by teacher Vipassi, teacher Sikhi and teacher Vessabhu did not last long. But the Dhamma established by Teacher Kakusanda, Teacher Konagamana and Teacher Kassapa lasted a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"And what is the reason why the Dhamma established by Master Vipassi, Master Sikhi and Master Vessabhu did not last long?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Master Vipassi, Master Sikhi and Master Vessabhu were deprived of the desire to give detailed teachings to their students. They gave few lectures in prose, in prose and verse, a few explanations, poems, inspirational sayings, quotations, birth stories, astonishing lectures, and analyses, and they did not lay down rules for teaching or reciting monastic rules. After the death of these Buddhas, after the death of the disciples awakened under their guidance, those who were the last disciples - with different names, from different clans and social classes, who went into a life of homelessness from their families - allowed the Dhamma to quickly disappear. It is like flowers released on a flat surface, scattered, scattered and destroyed by the wind. Why? Because they are not connected by a thread. In the same way, after the disappearance of these Buddhas, after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under their guidance, those who were the last disciples allow the Dhamma to quickly disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">But Sariputta, those Teachers, were tireless in admonishing their disciples after reading their minds. Once staying in a certain frightening forest grove, Master Vessabhu, the Perfect and Fully Awakened One, trained a thousand monks, reading their minds and saying, “Think like this” and not like that, pay attention to this and not that; throw it away; Having achieved this, abide in this.’ When these thousands of monks were trained by Master Vessabhu, their minds became free of defilements without clinging. But when anyone with sensual desire entered this frightening forest grove, usually his hair stood on end. This is the reason why the Dhamma established by Master Vipassi, Master Sikhi and Master Vessabhu did not last long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“What then is the reason why the Dhamma establishedteacher Kakusanda, teacher Konagamana and teacher Kassapa lasted a long time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Master Kakusanda, Master Konagamana and Master Kassapa were diligent in imparting detailed teachings to their students. They gave many lectures in prose, in prose and verse, many explanations, poems, inspirational sayings, quotations, birth stories, astounding lectures, and analyses; and they laid down the rules of learning and recited the monastic rules. After the departure of these Buddhas, after the disappearance of their disciples awakened by them, those who were the last disciples - of different names, clans, classes, who went into homeless life from different families - made sure that the Dhamma lasted a long time. It is like flowers on a flat surface held together by a thread: they are not scattered, twisted or destroyed by the wind. Why? Because they are held by a thread. Likewise, after the passing of those Buddhas, after the passing of the disciples awakened by those Buddhas under their guidance, those who were the last disciples made sure that the Dhamma would last a long time. This is the reason why the Dhamma established by Master Kakusanda, Master Konagamana and Master Kassapa lasted for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then Sariputta stood up from his seat, placed his monastic robe on his shoulder, folded his palms, and said, “This is the right time, Master, for establishing the rules of teaching and reciting the monastic rules , so that the Dhamma could exist for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Stop, Sariputta, Buddha knows the right time for this. The teacher does not establish the rules of training and monastic rules until cases of corruption occur in the monastic Order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And they will not arise until the monastic Order has existed for a long time, reached a large number, and an abundance of material support or great training. When will this happen? The teacher will then establish rules of instruction for his students and the recitation of monastic rules in order to curb these cases of corruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sariputta, the Order of monks is devoid of immorality, devoid of danger, impeccable, pure, established in essence. Even the least developed of these five hundred monks is one who has entered the stream, is not the subject of rebirth in the lower world, is confirmed in destiny, bound for awakening.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then the teacher said to Ananda, “Ananda is the custom of the Buddhas, not to wander around the country without saying goodbye to those who invited them to spend the rainy season (Vassu). Let's go to Brahmin Veranja and say goodbye."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">" Yes, Honorable One"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Teacher got dressed, took his cup and monastic robe, and with his accompanying Ananda, arrived at the dwelling of that Brahmin, where he sat down in the prepared place. The Brahmin approached the teacher, bowed to him and sat down on one side. And the teacher said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Brahmin, we have spent the rainy season as per your invitation, and now we are leaving you. We want to leave to wander around the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“It is true, it is good Gotama that you spent the rainy season according to my invitation, but I did not give a gift. This is not good. Not because I didn't want to, but because the life of a householder is full of worries and there are many things that I have to do. Can you and the Order of Monks please accept food from me tomorrow?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The teacher gave consent through silence. Then, after teaching, inspiring and delighting that Brahmin with the teaching, the Master got up from his place and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The next morning, the Brahmin prepared various types of good food in his own house and then notified the Master. “Now is the right time Gotama, the food is ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">After he had dressed the next morning, the teacher took his cup and monastic robe and, together with the order of monks, he arrived at the dwelling of that Brahmin and sat down on the prepared place. With his own hands, the Brahmin prepared various types of good food for the order of monks, under the direction of the Buddha. When they were satisfied and the teacher had finished his meal, the Brahmin gave a set of three robes to the Teacher, and two pieces of cloth to each monk. The teacher taught, inspired and delighted him with his teaching, and then got up from his seat and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">After remaining at Veranja for as long as he wished, the Master departed for Payagapattitthana via Soreyya, Sankassa and Kannakujja. There he crossed the Ganges River and went further to Benares. After staying in Benares for as long as he wanted, he set out to wander towards Vesali. When he eventually arrived in Vesali, he resided in the great Grove in a hall with a pointed roof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Verange chapter completed</span></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">1. The first rule of training</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Original story</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">First sub-story</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Once upon a time Sudinna, the son of a famous merchant, lived in the village of Kalandaka, not far from Vesali. It happened that Sudinna went to Vesali on some business with many friends. At that time, the teacher was sitting surrounded by a large gathering of people and giving teaching. When Sudinna saw this, he thought, “Why am I not listening to the teaching?” Then he approached this meeting and sat down at a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sitting there he thought, “As I understand the Master's teaching, it is not easy for one who lives the life of a householder to lead a spiritual life that is completely perfect and pure, polished like the shell of a shell. Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, and put on ocher robes, and go on into a homeless life?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">When those people were taught, inspired, and delighted by the Teacher, they stood up from their seats, bowed to the teacher, walked around him clockwise, and left.</ span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna approached the teacher, bowed to him, and sat down at a distance. And he told the teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Venerable One, as I understand the Master’s teaching, it is not easy for one who lives the life of a householder to lead a spiritual life that is completely perfect and pure, polished like the shell of a shell. I want to cut off my hair and beard, and put on ocher robes, and go forward into a homeless life. Teacher, please give me monastic ordination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">" But Sudinna, do you have permission from your parents?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“No, Honorable One”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"Sudinna, Buddhas do not give monastic ordination to the son of parents who have not given permission."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"I will do what is necessary, Honorable One, to obtain my parents' permission."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then, having completed his business in Vesali, Sudinna returned to Kalandaka. He then approached his parents and said, “Mother and Father, as I understand the teaching of the teacher, it is not easy for one who lives the life of a householder to lead a spiritual life that is completely perfect and pure. I want to cut off my hair and beard, and put on ocher robes, and go forward into a homeless life. Please give me permission to receive monastic ordination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">His parents replied, “But Sudinna, you are our only son. You are dear to us and we love you. You live in comfort and are well taken care of, you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died, it would be against our wishes. So how can we allow you to leave home, into a homeless life, when you are still alive?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna asked for the second time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">and a third time, but received the same answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then he lay down on the bare ground and said, “Either I die right here or go forward into a homeless life.” And he did not eat the next seven meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">His parents said, “Dear Sudinna, you are our only son. You are dear to us and we love you. You live in comfort and are well taken care of, you have no experience of suffering. Even if you died, it would be against our wishes. So how can we allow you to move forward from home into a homeless life when you are still alive?” Get up Sudinna, eat, drink, and entertain yourself. Enjoy sense pleasures and make merit. We won't let you get ahead." But Sudinna did not answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">His parents said the same thing a second and third time, but Sudinna remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then Sudinna's friends came and repeated three times what his parents had said. But Sudinna did not answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna's friends approached his parents and said, “Sudinna said that he would either die right here on the bare ground or go forward into a homeless life. If you don't let him go ahead, he will die here. But if you allow him to move forward into a homeless life, you will see him again later. And if he doesn't like going forward, what alternatives will he have but to come back here? So let him go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“We allow him,” they answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And Sudinna's friends told him, “Get up, Sudinna, your parents have given you permission to go ahead from home into homelessness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">CourtInna thought, “They said that my parents gave me permission to go ahead,” and he stood up excited and joyful, stroking his limbs with his hands. After spending a couple of days recuperating, he went to the Teacher, bowed to him and sat down at a distance. Then he said, “Venerable, I have received permission from my parents to move further from home into homelessness. Please give me monastic ordination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">He then received ordination as a novice in the presence of a teacher and was ordained as a monk. Soon after this, he practiced the following types of ascetic practices: living in the wilderness, going to pindapat, wearing old monastic robes, walking continuously to pindapat. And he lived supported by a certain Wajji village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">At that time the Vajjians were short of food and suffering from hunger, with crops spoiled and turned to straw, and it was not easy to obtain dana on pindapata. Venerable Sudinna thought about this and decided, “I have many relatives in Vesali and they are rich. Why shouldn't I live supported by them? Thanks to me, my relatives will be able to make offerings and accumulate merit, the monks will receive everything they need, and I will receive a lot of food from Pindapata.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then he put his home in order, took his cup and monastic robes and went to Vesali. When he finally arrived, he stopped in a gabled hall in a great forest. His relatives heard that he had arrived in Vesali and they presented him with offerings of sixty portions of food. Sudinna gave sixty portions of food to the monks, and taking his bowl and monastic robe, he entered the village of Kalandaku to get the dana. As he continued his continuous walk to Pindapat, he arrived at his father's house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Immediately after this, the woman slave of the relatives of the Venerable Sudinna wanted to throw away the porridge from the previous evening. Sudinna told her, “Sister, if this is thrown away, put it here in my bowl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Putting the porridge into the bowl, she recognized his arms, legs and voice. Then she went to his mother and said, “Please know lady that the young teacher Sudinna has returned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“If you speak the truth, I will free you woman!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">When at the base of a certain wall, Sudinna was eating porridge from the previous evening,&nbsp; his father saw him as he was returning from work. He approached him and said: “But Sudina, isn’t there... and you’re eating old porridge! Don't you have your own home to visit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“We have arrived at your house, householder. That's where we got this mess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna's father took him by the hand and said: “Come on, let's go to the house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna entered his father's house and sat down on the prepared place. His father told him: “Eat, Sudinna.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“No need, householder; I finished my meal for today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"Then please come back for lunch tomorrow."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna agreed with silence, and got up from his seat and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The next morning, Sudinna's Mother collected earth smeared with fresh cow dung, and she collected two heaps on it, one with money and one with gold. The piles were so large that a person standing on one side could not see a person standing on the other. Hiding the piles with screens and preparing a space between them surrounded by a curtain, she said to Sudinna's ex-wife, “Sister-in-law, decorate yourself in such a way that Sudinna will find you especially attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Yes madam.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">That same morning the Venerable Sudinna got dressed, took his cup and robes and went to his father’s house, where he sat down on the prepared place. His father approached him, opened the heaps and said: “This dowry, dear Sudinna, is your mother’s wealth, and it is yours. Another is wealth from your father, and another is wealth from your ancestors. It is possible, Sudinna, for you to return to the lower life and enjoy wealth and make merit.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Please do this."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“I can’t, father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I enjoy my spiritual life." Sudinna's father repeated his request and Sudinna responded as before. Sudinna's father repeated his request for the third time, and Sudinna replied: “If&nbsp; you won't be offended, householder, I could tell you what to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Speak, Sudinna.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“So, householder, make several large bags of hemp, put everything inmoney and gold inside,</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Take it all in carts and dump it in the middle of the Ganges. And for what? Because in this way you will avoid the danger, fear and horror that they will cause you, as well as problems with protection."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">His father was unhappy and thought: “How can our son Sudinna say such things?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then he said to Sudinna's ex-wife: “Well, now, daughter-in-law, since you were dear to him, perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to you.”</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Reverend Sudinna's ex-wife grabbed him by the legs and said: “What are these nymphs, young master, for whose sake you are leading a spiritual life?”</span></p >
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Sister, I do not lead a spiritual life for the sake of the nymphs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">His ex-wife thought: “From today on, the young teacher calls me “sister,” and she fainted on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna said to his father: “If there is food to be given, householder, give it, but do not irritate me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Eat, Sudinna,” he said. And with their own hands Sudinna's mother and father served and satisfied him with various types of good food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">When Sudinna finished his meal, his mother said to him: “Dear Sudinna, this family is rich.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">You can return to the lower life, enjoy wealth and make merit. Please do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"Mom I can't, I</span><span style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;enjoy spiritual life."</span </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The mother repeated her request a second time, but received the same answer. Then she said, “This family, Sudinna, is rich. Please give us a child; Don’t let Lichchhavi take possession of our ancestral property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Okay, Mom, I can do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Where do you live now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"In the Great Forest." And he got up from his place and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna's mother said to his ex-wife: “Daughter-in-law, once you reach your fertile period, please inform me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Okay, madam,” she replied. Soon after this, Sudinna's ex-wife reached her fertile period and she informed Sudinna's mother about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna finds you especially attractive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Okay, madam,” she replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then Sudinna's mother along with his ex-wife approached Sudinna in the Big Forest and she told him: “This family, dear Sudinna, is rich. One can return to the lower life, enjoy wealth and make merit. Please do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Mom, I can’t. I enjoy spiritual life."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The mother repeated her request a second time, but received the same answer. Then she said the following: “This family, Sudinna, is rich. Please give us a child; Do not let Licchavi take possession of our ancestral property."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Okay, Mom, I can do it,” he said. Then he took his ex-wife by the hand, entered the Great Forest and, since there were no rules of training and he saw no danger, he copulated with her three times. As a result, she became pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The earthly gods (Bhumadevas) exclaimed: “Good sirs, the Order of monks was flawless and free from danger. But Sudinna Kalandaka polluted him and created danger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The gods belonging to the heavens of the four great kings, hearing the cry of the earthly gods, in turn shouted... the gods of Tavatimsa... the gods of Yama... the gods of Tusita... the gods who enjoy creation …</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">The gods who control the creation of others... the gods belonging to the retinue of higher beings, in turn, shouted: “Good sirs, the Order of monks was flawless and free from danger. But Sudinna Kalandaka polluted him, created danger.” Thus, at that moment, because of this incident, the news spread to the world of superior beings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sudinna's wife's pregnancy progressed and she eventually gave birth to a son. Sudinna's friends called this boy Bijaka, they called Sudinna's ex-wife Bijaka's mother,</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">And they called the father of the venerable Sudinna the father of Bijaka. After some time, they both left home for a homeless life, and reached the highest level.</span></p>
<p><span stylee="font-size: 20px;">But Sudinna was worried and full of remorse, and he thought: “It is really bad for me that, having gone into a homeless life in such a well-proclaimed Doctrine and Discipline, I could not practice for the sake of life completely complete and spiritually pure. “And because of this worry and repentance he became thin, gaunt and pale, his veins sticking out along his limbs; He became sad, lethargic, unhappy, depressed, repentant, burdened with grief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The monks who were friends of the Venerable Sudinna said to him: “Formerly Sudinna, you were handsome, your features were round, your face was of good color, your skin was clear. But now you are thin, gaunt and pale, your veins protruding from your limbs; And you are sad, lethargic, unhappy, depressed, repentant, burdened with grief. Are you really leading a spiritual life being dissatisfied?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“I don’t lead a spiritual life being dissatisfied, but I did a bad thing. I had sexual intercourse with my ex-wife. That's why I'm so unhappy. I could not practice for the sake of living a completely full and spiritually pure life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Sudinna, no wonder you have repented, no wonder you feel regret that, having gone forward into such well-proclaimed teaching and learning, you could not practice for the sake of living a completely full and spiritually pure life.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Didn't the teacher teach in different ways for the sake of impartiality, and not for the sake of passion; For the sake of freedom from slavery, not for the sake of slavery; For the sake of not being greedy, and not for the sake of greed?</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">When the teacher taught in this way, how can you be carried away by passion, slavery and greed? Didn't the teacher give many teachings for the extinction of sensual desire, for the elimination of intoxication, for the elimination of thirst, for the eradication of attachment, for cutting off the circle of birth and death, for the end of thirst, for extinction, for cessation, for extinction? Didn't the teacher teach in various ways the renunciation of sense pleasures, the complete understanding of the perception of sense pleasures, the elimination of craving for sense pleasures, the elimination of thoughts of sense pleasures, the calming of the fever of sense pleasures? This will not lead to faith in those without it, or to increase faith in those who have it, but it will discourage faith in those without it, and it will cause some who have faith to change. opinion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">After criticizing Venerable Sudinna in various ways, these monks informed the Master. Then the Master assembled the order of monks and asked Venerable Sudinna:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“Is it true, Sudinna, that you had sexual intercourse with your ex-wife?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“It’s true, Teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Buddha reprimanded him: “Foolish man, this is not suitable, this is not right, this is not worthy of an ascetic, this is unacceptable, this should not be done. How could you go ahead into a homeless life in such well-proclaimed teaching and training and fail to practice for a life that is completely complete and spiritually pure? Have I not given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, and not for the sake of passion; For the sake of freedom from bonds, not for the sake of bonds; For the sake of not clinging, and not for the sake of clinging? When I have taught in this way, how can you be carried away by passion, bonds and clinging? Have I not given many teachings for the extinction of sensual desire, for the elimination of intoxication, for the elimination of thirst, for the eradication of attachment, for cutting off the circle of birth and death, for the completion of thirst, for extinction, for cessation, for extinction? Have I not taught in various ways renunciation of sense pleasures, complete understanding of the perception of sense pleasures, elimination of craving for sense pleasures, elimination of thoughts of sense pleasures, calming the fever of sense pleasures? It would be better, stupid man, if your penis entered the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than entered into a woman. It would be better to have your penis in the mouth of a black snake than to have it in a woman. It would be better if your penis ended up in a blazing coal pit rather than a woman. And why? Because in that case, you could die or experience mortal suffering, but you will not, because because of this, you will be reborn in a bad place. For this reason you can . Foolish man, you practice what is contrary to the true Teaching, ordinary practice, low practice, gross practice, which ends in washing, what is done in private, what is done where there are couples.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">You are the forerunner, the first performer of many negative things. This will not increase the confidence of those without it, or increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder the confidence of those without it, and it will cause someyou can confidently change your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then the teacher condemned the difficulty of maintaining and cultivating, condemned great desires, lack of satisfaction, communication and laziness; But he praised in various ways, ease of maintenance and cultivation, small desires, contentment, desire to be invisible, hermit practices, serenity, reduction of defilements and investment of effort. Having given the teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Because of this, monks, I will lay down the rules of training for monks for the following ten reasons:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">For the well-being of the Order, for the convenience of the Order, for the restraint of bad people, for the convenience of good monks, for restraining corruption in the present life, in order to avoid corruption in the future life, to give trust in those without it, to increase confidence in those who have it, to continue true teaching, and to support learning. And, monks, this rule of teaching should be recited like this:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">First preliminary rule</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“If a monk has had sexual intercourse, he is excluded and is not a member of the Community.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Thus the teacher established the training rule for the monks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">This section of recitation on Sudinna is finished</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Second sub-story</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Some time later, in the Great Forest of Vesali, a monk was supporting a female monkey, giving her food, and then copulating with her. One morning he got dressed, took his cup and robe and entered Vesali to receive dana (offerings). At this time, several monks came to the monastic dwelling and inspected the dwelling. The female monkey saw the monks approaching. She walked up to them, shook her buttocks in front of them, waved her tail, put her buttocks up and made a gesture.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">The monks thought: “This monk must be having sexual intercourse with this monkey,” and they hid to the side. Then, when this monk finished his walk for offerings&nbsp; in Vesali and returned from going for offerings, he himself ate some of it and gave the rest to the female monkey. After eating the food, the monkey offered her buttocks to the monk, and he had sexual intercourse with her. These monks said to this monk: “Wasn’t the rule made by the teacher? Why are you having sexual intercourse with a monkey? “It is true that the teacher has set a teaching rule, but it applies to human women, not to animals.” “But it's the same thing. This is not suitable, this is not right, this is not worthy of a hermit, this is unacceptable, this should not be done. How could you go ahead into this well-proclaimed teaching and training and not be able to practice for a life that is completely full and spiritually pure? Didn't the Master teach in various ways for the sake of dispassion... to calm the fever of sensual pleasures? This will not lead to trust in those without it, or increase confidence in those who have it, but it will discourage trust in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.” After criticizing this monk in various ways, they reported to the teacher. The teacher then told the order of monks to assemble and asked that monk, “Is it true, monk, that you had sexual intercourse with a monkey?” "It's true, Master." The Buddha reproached him: “Foolish man, this is not suitable, this is not right, this is not worthy of an ascetic, this is unacceptable, this should not be done. How could you go into such a well-proclaimed teaching and training and not be able to practice for a life of perfection and spiritual purity? Have I not given many instructions for the sake of impartiality... to calm the fever of sensual pleasures? It would be better, foolish man, for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter the female. It would be better for your penis to end up in the mouth of a black snake than to enter a female. It would be better if your penis ended up in a blazing coal mine rather than a female. And why is that? Because in that case, you could die or experience mortal suffering, but you will not, because because of this, you will be reborn in a bad place. For this reason you may experience. Foolish man, you practice what is contrary to the true teaching, ordinary practice, low practice, gross practice, ending with washing, what is done in private, what is done where there are couples.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Stupid person, this will not lead to confidence in someone who lacks it...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">So, monks, this rule of training should be read like this:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Second preliminary ruling</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“If a monk has had sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is excluded, and not from the Community.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Thus the teacher established a training rule for the monks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The story of the female monkey is completed.</span></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Third sub-story</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Around the same time, a large number of Vajja monks from Vesali ate, slept and bathed as much as they liked. While doing this, and without properly realizing it, they had intercourse, but [did this] without abandoning monasticism and revealing their weakness. After some time, they were stricken due to the loss of relatives, loss of property and illness. Then they approached Venerable Ananda and said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Reverend Ananda, we do not blame the Buddha, the Teaching or the Order;</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">We only blame ourselves. We were unfortunate and had only a small merit: after going into such well-proclaimed training and practice,&nbsp; we were unable to practice for the sake of living a spiritually full and pure life. If we were now tonsured and fully ordained in the presence of a teacher, we would have clarity regarding useful qualities, and we&nbsp; dedicate yourself day by day to developing the means for awakening.. Reverend Ananda, please inform the teacher about this. «</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Yes,” he replied. And he went to the teacher and told him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">"It is impossible, Ananda, that the Buddha should abolish the rule of teaching that entails the expulsion of the Vajjians."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then the Teacher gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, if a monk has not renounced monasticism and has not revealed his weakness, and at the same time he commits sexual intercourse, then he cannot receive full monastic ordination. But, monks, if someone has sexual intercourse after leaving monasticism and declaring weakness [inability to lead the monastic life], he can receive full monastic ordination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">So, monks, this rule of training should be read like this:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Final resolution</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">“If any monk, having accepted monastic training and the way of life of monks, without first renouncing monastic training and not reporting his weakness [inability to lead a monastic life], commits sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, then he is excluded and not in the Community.” «</span></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Definitions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Whatever: whoever, of this kind, such activity, such social status, such name, such family, such course of action, such behavior, such association who is older, who is younger or who is middle-aged - this is called “any.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Monk: he is a monk because he lives on offerings; a monk because he switched to offerings; a monk, because he is the one who wears cloth sewn from scraps; monk by convention; a monk because of his recognition as one; monk “through a call to monasticism”; a monk who has received full monastic ordination through refuge in the three jewels; good monk; in the state of a monk; trainee monk; a fully trained monk; a monk who has been given full ordination by the full Sangha through a formal procedure consisting of one petition and three announcements, uncontested and eligible for becoming a monk. A monk who has been given full ordination by a full order through a formal procedure consisting of one movement and three declarations, which is indisputable and suitable for becoming a monk, in this case this type of monk is implied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Training: three trainings: training in the highest morality, training in the higher mind, training in the highest wisdom. Training in higher morality is training intended for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Lifestyle: any learning rule established by the teacher is called a “lifestyle”. He is trained in it, which is why it is said “after adopting […] a way of life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Without first giving up learning and revealing your weakness: “There is, monks, revealing weakness without giving up learning; and there is identification of weakness along with refusal to learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And how can you identify weakness without giving up learning? Here the monk has dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, a desire to abandon the life of an ascetic; anxiety, shame and aversion to monasticism; the desire to become a householder, the desire to become a follower, the desire to be a monastic assistant, the desire to be a novice, wanting to be an ascetic of another sect, the desire to be a follower of another sect, the desire not to be an ascetic, wanting not to be a son of Sakya, and he says and declares: “Why should I not to give up Buddha? Thus, monks, there is the revelation of weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, the desire to abandon the life of an ascetic; anxiety, shame and aversion to monasticism; desire to become a householder... not wanting to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “Why don’t I give up the teaching?” ...orders?

<span style="font-size: 20px;">he speaks and declares: “Why do I not renounce my fellow monks?” “Why don’t I become a stay-at-home dad?” … “Why don’t I become a follower?” “Why shouldn’t I become a monastic follower? "..."Why don't I become a novice? "..."Why don't I become an ascetic of another sect? "..."Why don't I become a follower of another sect? "..."Why don't I become an ascetic of another sect? "Why don't I become a non-son of Sakya? "In the same way, monks, there is identifying weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, the desire to abandon the life of an ascetic; anxiety, shame and aversion to monasticism; desire to become a householder... not desire to be a Sakya son, he speaks and declares: “But if I renounce Buddha”... he speaks and declares: “But if I were not a Sakya son”... he speaks and declares: “Perhaps I should renounce Buddha? ... he speaks and declares: “Maybe I shouldn’t be the son of Sakya?” ... he says and declares: “Well, then I must renounce the Buddha” ... he speaks and declares: “Well, then I must not be the son of Sakya ... he speaks and declares: “I think I must renounce the Buddha” ... he speaks and declares: "I think that I should not be the son of Sakya." In the same way, monks, there is identification of weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, wanting to give up the life of an ascetic; being in anxiety, in shame and disgust towards monasticism; wanting to be a householder... wanting not to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: "I remember my mother" ... "I remember my father" ... "I remember my brother" ... "I remember my sister" ... "I remember my son..." I remember my daughter" ... "I remember my wife" ... "I remember my relationships" ... "I remember my friends" ... "I remember my village" ... "I remember my city" ... "I remember my fields ... "I remember my land" ... "I remember my money" ... "I remember my gold" ... "I remember my profession" ... he speaks and declares: “I remember my old laughter, chatter and play. ‘</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Thus, monks, there is identification of weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, wanting to give up the life of an ascetic; being in anxiety, shame and disgust towards monasticism; wanting to become a householder... wanting not to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “I have a mother whom I need to support”...</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">“I have a father to support”… “I have a brother…” I have a sister… “I have a son…” I have a daughter… “I have I have a wife..." I have a relationship... he says and states: "I have friends that I need to support." In the same way, monks, there is identification of weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, wanting to give up the life of an ascetic; in anxiety, shame and disgust towards monasticism; wanting to become a householder... not wanting to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “I have a mother; she will support me." "I have a father; he will support me." "I have a brother; he will support me." "I have a sister; she will support me." "I have a son; he will support me." "I have a daughter; she will support me."

"I have land; I will live through her. “...” I have money; I will live through them. “…“I have gold; I will live through it." He speaks and declares: “U mShe has a profession; I will live through her." In the same way, monks, there is identifying weakness without giving up learning</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, experiencing dissatisfaction, discontent, wanting to give up the life of an ascetic; experiencing anxiety, shame and disgust towards monasticism; aspiring to become a householder... not wanting to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “it is difficult to do.” "It's not easy to do." "it's complicated". “it’s not easy.” “I can’t tolerate.” “I can’t.” “I don’t enjoy.” “I don’t feel any delight.” In the same way, monks, there is the revelation of weakness without giving up learning.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And how does weakness manifest itself along with refusal to learn? The monk is dissatisfied, disappointed, wants to give up the life of an ascetic; worried, ashamed and disgusted with monasticism; wants to become a householder...does not want to be the son of Sakya, and he says and declares: “I renounce Buddha.” Thus, monks, there is identification of weakness along with renunciation of learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, wants to give up the life of an ascetic; worried, ashamed and disgusted with monasticism; striving to become a householder... wanting not to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “I renounce the Teaching”...</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">"I renounce the Order" ... "I renounce practice" ... "I renounce teaching" ... "I renounce the monastic code" ... "I renounce recitations" ... " I refuse my mentor" ... "I refuse my teacher" ... "I refuse to be a student" ... "I refuse to be a learner" ...</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">"I renounce our common master" ... "I renounce our common teacher" ... he speaks and declares: "I renounce my fellow monks" ... he speaks and declares : “Consider me a householder” ... “Consider me a follower” ... Consider me an inhabitant of a monastery ... “Consider me a novice (samanera)” ... “Consider me an ascetic of another sect” ... “Consider me a follower of another sect "... "Consider me an ascetic" ... "Do not consider me the son of Sakya." Thus, monks show weakness along with refusal to study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again, dissatisfied, dissatisfied, wanting to give up the life of an ascetic; in anxiety, shame and disgust towards monasticism; wanting to become a householder... wanting not to be the son of Sakya, he speaks and declares: “I am done with Buddha”... “I am done with my fellow monks.” In the same way, monks, there is identification of weakness along with renunciation of learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again... he speaks and declares: “For me there is no more Buddha”... “For me there is no more than my fellow monks.” Thus, monks...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again... he speaks and declares: “I don’t need the Buddha”... “I don’t need my fellow monks.” Thus, monks...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or again... he speaks and declares: "I am well liberated from the Buddha." "I am well liberated from my fellow monks." In the same way, monks, there is identification of weakness along with renunciation of learning</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Or any other synonyms for Buddha, for Teaching, Order, for practice, for training, for monastic code, for recitations, for mentor, for teacher, for student, for a student, for an ordinary master, for a general teacher, for another monk, for a householder, for a lay follower, for a monastery servant, for a novice monk, for an ascetic of another sect, for a follower of another sect, for one who is not an ascetic or who is not a son Sakya, he speaks and declares through these indications through these signs through these signs. Thus, monks, there is identification of weakness along with renunciation of learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And how do they not refuse to study? If someone refuses to teach according to these indications, through these marks, through these signs, but if he is insane, then the training is not canceled. If someone refuses to study in the presence of someone who is crazy, the learning is not canceled.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">If someone who is abnormal refuses to study, the training is not canceled. If someone refuses to learn in the presence of someone who is abnormal, the training is not cancelled. If one who is filled with pain refuses to learn, the training is not canceled. If someone refuses to learn in the presence of someone who is filled with pain, the training is not canceled. If someone refuses to teach God, the training is not canceled. If someone refuses to train an animal, the training is not canceled. If an Indian refuses to teach a foreigner who does not understand him, the training is not cancelled. If a foreigner refuses to teach an Indian who does not understand him, the training is not cancelled. If the Indian refusesWhen learning to another Indian who does not understand him, learning is not cancelled.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">If a foreigner refuses to teach another foreigner who does not understand him, the training is not cancelled. If he refuses the training as a joke, the training will not be cancelled. If he refuses the training by speaking too quickly, the training is not cancelled. If he declares something he does not want to declare, the training is not canceled. If he does not announce what he wants to announce, the training is not cancelled. If he announces to someone who does not understand, the training is not canceled. If he does not announce to someone who does not understand, the training is not canceled. Or, if he does not make a full announcement, the training is not cancelled. Thus, monks, training is not canceled."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Sexual intercourse: what is contrary to the true teaching, ordinary practice, low practice, crude practice, which ends with ablution, what is done in private, what is done wherever there are couples - this is called “Sexual Intercourse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Has: an organ with an organ, genitals with genitals, even a depth the size of a sesame seed - this is called “having.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Even with a female animal:</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">even having sexual intercourse with a female animal, he is not an ascetic, not the son of Sakya; and even more so with a woman - that’s why they say “even with a female animal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">He is excluded: just as a person with his head cut off cannot continue to live by reconnecting it to the body, so a monk who has had sexual intercourse is not ascetic, son of Sakya, therefore it is said, “He is excluded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Not in commonality: Commonality: common formal procedures, the same recitations, the same training - this is called “commonality”. He does not participate in this, which is why it is said “not in community.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Then rub between your thighs... Then you will come with my hand; this way you will not have a violation.” The monk acted accordingly. He began to regret... “There is no violation that entails expulsion, but there is a violation that entails removal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">One day in Vesali, some Lichawi youths took possession of a monk and forced him to commit an offense with a nun... forced him to commit an offense with a trainee nun... forced him to commit an offense with a novice nun . Both agreed: both should be expelled. None of them agreed: there is no violation for either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Once in Vesali, some Lichhavi youths grabbed a monk and forced him to commit a crimeok with the prostitute... forced him to commit an offense with a eunuch... forced him to commit an offense with a householder. The monk agreed: he should be expelled. The monk did not agree: there is no violation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">One day in Vesali, several young men from the Lichchhavi clan captured two monks and forced them to commit misdeeds with each other. Both agreed: both should be expelled. None of them agreed: each of them has no violations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Once a monk, who took monastic vows in old age, went to see his ex-wife. She said, “Come, Venerable One, leave the Order,” and she grabbed him. Stepping back, the monk fell on his back. She pulled off his robe and sat on his dick. He began to repent... “Did you agree, monk?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“I did not agree, teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“There is no violation for anyone who disagrees.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Once a monk remained in the desert. The young deer walked to the urination site, drank the urine and took the monk's penis into his mouth. The monk agreed. He began to repent... “You committed a violation that resulted in expulsion.”</span></p>
