		<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indecent remarks</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Violation</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If any monk, overcome by desire, with a distorted mind, addresses a woman with obscene words, just as a young man addresses a girl with a hint of sexual intercourse, this entails the initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. “At that time Ven. Udain lived in a deserted area. And one day many women came to the monastery to look at his home. They went to Ven. Udain and upon arrival were told: “Reverend, we would like to inspect your home.” And then Ven. Udain, showing women his home, using </font></font></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">references to their genitals and anus, praised and blamed, asked and begged, questioned and inquired, taught and advised, and insulted them. Those women who were shameless, mischievous and shameless giggled along with Ven. Udain, they persuaded him, laughed loudly and teased him. And those women who had a feeling of shame after leaving the Ven. Udaina began to complain to the monks: “This is obscene, venerable ones, this is inappropriate! We don’t even want to hear such words out loud from our husbands, not to mention Ven. Udaine." The commentary lists five factors that must be present in case of a complete violation of this rule: 1) Object: woman, i.e. any female person experienced enough to understand what is decent and what is indecent to say, what is decent and what is obscene. 2) Understanding: the monk understands that this is exactly the woman in front of him. 3) Intention: it is driven by passionate desire. As in the previous rule, we can take the definition of craving given in the commentary as the minimum amount of desire to fulfill the factor: He wants to get pleasure from saying something obscene or inappropriate. 4) Effort: He makes comments praising, blaming, begging, pleading, inquiring, inquiring, teaching, advising or insulting with reference to her genitals or anus, or performing sexual intercourse on her. 5) Result: the woman immediately understands what is said. The factors that require detailed explanation here are object, intention, effort and result.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An object.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the commentary notes, a woman who does not know what is decent to say and what is indecent, what is decent to say and what is obscene, may be too small, or, if she is an adult, too innocent or mentally retarded to understand. A woman who does not know the language spoken by a monk is also not subject to this rule.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intention.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The minimum level of desire required to satisfy this factor means that this rule covers cases where a monk simply takes pleasure in mentioning female genitalia and other things in the presence of a woman, including without any desire to have sexual intercourse with her. The Vibhanga explains that words spoken in a fit of anger do not fall under this rule. Therefore, any insults that a monk utters against a woman not out of desire, but as a result of anger, then, even if they mention her genitals and so on, they fall under Paccitiya 2 and not under this rule.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An effort</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Vibhanga states that for complete violation, a monk in a conversation with a woman must mention her genitals, anus or performing sexual intercourse. The commentary develops this theme and makes the statement that for complete violation a monk must make a direct reference to one of these three things, or accuse a woman of sexual inferiority by direct reference to her genitals. Otherwise, if a monk lewdly alludes to these things without mentioning them directly, there is no violation of the class of sanghadises, although the sub-commentary quotes </font></font></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from ancient texts called Ganthipadas, which suggest that this should count as duccata. However, these statements from the commentaries contradict Vibhanga. After listing the ways in which references to the genitals, anus, and sexual intercourse can be considered a total violation for a monk, examples are given. In many examples, although references are made to the intimate parts of a woman’s body, the words themselves denoting them are not pronounced: “How do you give to your husband?”, “How do you give to your lover?”, “When will your mother come to terms (with our sex with you)”, “ When will you have a good opportunity? Although all of these statements allude to sexual intercourse and people at the time would have understood them in that light, none of them explicitly mention it. Therefore, the examples in Vibhanga show that if a monk uses slang expressions, euphemisms or indirect statements to lustfully refer to a woman's private parts or engage in sexual intercourse, this factor should be considered fulfilled. There is no need for euphemisms to be well known. If the speaker intentionally used them to mention taboo topics, it fulfills the effort factor here. If the listener understands them in this light [as the speaker intended], the outcome factor is satisfied. Whether anyone else understands them correctly is irrelevant. The commentary states that a hand gesture indicating the genitals, anus and sexual intercourse involving the person to whom it is directed also fulfills the effort factor here. None of the texts mention episodes when a monk talks to one person about the private parts of another’s body, etc. Therefore, such behavior does not appear to constitute a violation.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Result.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The commentary strongly states that the outcome factor is only satisfied when the woman immediately understands what is being said. As noted in the Vibhanga, if she does not understand, the monk is charged with a less serious offense, which will be discussed below. If she understands only after some time, this does not make the less serious offense a sanghadisesa. From the examples in Vinita-vatthu it is clear that a woman's immediate understanding is determined by her immediate reaction to the words of the monk. Derivative violations. The factors of effort, object and result give a certain number of combinations for which penalties of lesser severity are counted. Regarding combinations with intention, see the “actions that are not violations” section below.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An effort.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The monk addresses a woman whom he takes to be a woman and lasciviously refers to parts of her body other than the intimate ones, below the collarbone and above the knee, such as breasts, buttocks or thighs: thullacchaya. The monk mentions parts of her body outside this zone, such as her face or hairstyle, clothes or jewelry on her: dukkata.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An object.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The monk talks to the pandaka (hereinafter we assume that he correctly understands who the interlocutor is) and lasciviously mentions his intimate parts of the body or sexual intercourse with his participation: thullacchaya. </font></font></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He lasciviously mentions other parts of the pandaka's body, his clothes, etc.: dukkata. A monk talks to a man (or boy) and lustfully mentions any part of his body, clothing, etc.: duccata. The same penalty applies when talking to an animal, such as Naga, about his/her body, jewelry, etc. For some reason, the PTS edition of the canon does not have a section on derivative violations against an object. In the Burmese and Lankan editions there are ambiguities on this topic, since these paragraphs are filled with ellipses, which are understood in two ways. The PTS edition of the commentary interprets these ellipses as thullacchaya and dukkata for lustful conversations with a pandaka, but without mentioning dukkata for lustful conversations with a man or animal. The editors of the Thai edition of the canon, using the proximity to a similar paragraph in Sanghadises 2, interpreted the ellipses to mean "man" and "animal" and therefore included these situations in the text. This interpretation closes an important loophole and therefore seems more correct, so I follow it here. None of the texts mention the situation of lustful conversations with a woman/girl who is still too inexperienced to understand what is decent and what is not. However, using the "primary standards" we can infer from the situations in Vinitavatthu (where the monks referred to women's private parts using wordplay and the women did not understand) that a monk is credited with thullacchaya for directly mentioning in her presence her genitals, anus, or performing her of sexual intercourse, and dukkat for indirect mention of these things in her presence.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Understanding</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A monk speaking to a woman whom he mistakes for someone else (pandaka, man, animal) is considered thullacchaya if he makes lascivious references to her genitals, anus or sexual intercourse. If he speaks to a pandaka, a man or an animal, mistaking him for someone else, for example he mistakes a pandaka for a woman, a man for a pandaka, an animal for a man, he is credited with duccata if the monk mentions these things lustfully. (Again, the PTS edition skips most of these situations in the previous sentence and only talks about the monk talking lustfully to a pandaka he thinks is a woman. The Thai edition seems to be more accurate because it covers the remaining situations.)</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Result.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As mentioned earlier, the Vinita-vatthu contains a number of episodes where monks, when talking to women, make references to their genitals through wordplay, but the women do not understand what is said. In one of the cases, thullacchaya was counted, in the rest, duccata. The commentary does not note this difference; the subcommentary does note it, but the authors apparently had difficulty explaining them. In fact, the statement is made there that the monk, in the case of thullacchaya, receives it if the woman understands the pun. But this statement, given the rather obvious meaning of that play on words, is meaningless. However, there is logic in the episodes from Vinita-vatthu. The case of thullacchaya is the only one in which the monk explicitly uses a word for the genitals or anus (the word magga also means "road", and the woman knew this meaning). In cases of duccats, monks either used euphemisms for sexual intercourse ("ploughing", "work") or uttered statements in which the genitals or </font></font></span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">anus were implied, but the words themselves were not actually spoken. From this logic we can conclude that if a monk speaking to a woman uses a direct reference to her genitals or anus and the woman does not immediately understand what exactly he is talking about, the monk is credited with thullacchaya. If he uses a euphemism to refer to sexual intercourse or uses an implicit reference to the genitals or anus and she cannot immediately understand what exactly he is talking about, the monk is credited with a duccata.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Calculation of the number of violations.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A monk who makes references described by this rule in a conversation with N women commits N violations, the severity of which is determined by the factors discussed above. Therefore, for making a lustful comment to two women about their breasts, he gets two thullachchai. For making a lustful comment to three men about their bodies - three duccats. Teasing a group of twenty older women that their time for sexual activity has passed is twenty sanghadises.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actions that are not violations.</font></font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Vibhanga says that there is no violation for a monk if he speaks for the purpose of (spiritual) well-being (attha - can also mean "the meaning of Dhamma"), having the name Dhamma as the goal or having the goal of learning. Therefore, for example, if a monk tells something to women without having a lustful intention, he can recite the text of this rule, explain its meaning, or go into detail when considering the topic of unattractiveness of the body as a topic of meditation, and he will not be counted as a violation. The commentary on this subject gives the example of a monk who addresses a sexually defective woman, telling her to be diligent in her practice so that she will not be reborn with such defects again. However, if a monk delves into any of these topics out of desire for the pleasure of saying something obscene to his listeners, he is not exempt from punishment. The new subcommentary illustrates this by having a monk teach a nun the Vibhanga text on the topic, deviating from the normal tone of the narrative and giggling as he utters examples of obscene language. It is said that this kind of behavior is a complete violation here. A monk who, without intending to say anything obscene, utters neutral words that his listeners take to be obscene, does not count as an infraction.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summary:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Speaking lustfully to a woman about her genitals, anus or performing sexual intercourse is a violation of the class of sanghadises.</font></font></span></p>
