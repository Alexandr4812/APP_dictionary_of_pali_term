                </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (tilakkhana)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the concept</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> of anicca</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . What is anicca? We usually say that anicca is impermanence. Everything changes, is destroyed, if something has arisen, then it will definitely end, if some creature is born, then it will definitely die. We call this characteristic of impermanence “anicca.” But in fact, this explanation is very superficial.</font></font></font> 
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anicca is an extremely deep concept that requires careful analysis and study. We have to see what anicca is, then we will actually have wisdom. This wisdom helps us in reducing suffering and liberation from it. With the help of wisdom we know that the concept of anicca goes very deep.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even if a person has this superficial understanding, it already brings him some happiness. If we have the understanding that we can die at any moment, that we cannot stop death, then we know that we will have to leave this world and go away. We will have to part with the world, with our parents, relatives, children, with all our loved ones. All these people we met - we met them only for a while. Our meeting is temporary, we came into this world for a short time.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why should we constantly remember this? Because it is a process of reflection, education of the mind, development of the mind. While a person does not have any deep wisdom, he simply conducts some kind of thinking. And if he reflects, then he comes to understanding.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He understands: “There is no need for me to become so attached to this world if I have to part with it at any moment, if I have to leave at any moment. Why should I love this world so much?” And if a person thinks so even a little, then, although he lives in this world, he will have little affection and few grievances. Why hold grudges for so long? It's like we've been living here forever. We did not come here forever and those whom we hate will also leave. Maybe they’ve even already left, they just haven’t given us this information yet, and we continue to hate them. Why do we need this? This hatred will bring misfortune to ourselves. Even this top-level understanding of aniccha gives a person a certain level of happiness, liberation, this is mandatory.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the meanings of the concept anicca is change: everything changes. The way we thought as children, or the way we thought when we were young, we don’t think that way now. Why is that? Because the mind is impermanent, the mind changes. Even this understanding gives us some kind of wisdom, some kind of liberation. But the way the Buddha taught to see anicca is a very deep understanding, it goes even further. Therefore, we cannot stop at this superficial level of understanding.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who do not know about the Buddha's Teaching may also think about it and understand it superficially, but it is not a deep Dhamma. Of course, if a person begins to think, then he understands that all people die. “No one has ever stayed here forever, so I will leave too” – you don’t need any deep level of wisdom to understand this.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As Buddha said: “sabbe sankhara anicca ti.” All sankharas, constructions - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">anichatti</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , are impermanent. This means: what arises disappears. Leaving nothing here.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sankharas</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ? Sankhara means something that has arisen due to causes. Everything that has arisen due to causes can be called sankharas. Everything that has arisen: the house, the world, people. Sankhara is a separate large concept, it needs to be analyzed separately (see Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lecture “ </font></font><a href="https://theravada.ru/Teaching/Lectures/bodhi_sankhara-sv.htm" target="_blank"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All sankharas are impermanent</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ”). But there is another meaning for the word “sankhara”: volitional formations of the mind, thinking. When we say "sabbe sankhara aniccha ti", all sankharas are impermanent, this means all the things that are in the world, or of which the world is made up, are called sankharas, and they are all impermanent.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How can we see that the world is impermanent? This is a very interesting question, and we must understand it correctly. If we misunderstand it, then we misunderstand the Buddha's Teaching, and we don't even know how to understand it. Let's say I'm sitting on this chair - this chair is not permanent. How do we understand that he is fickle? To this, any person will answer us: this chair was different before, it had a different color, it has aged, some time will pass and it will break, and so on, so the chair is not permanent. But in fact, such a superficial explanation is wrong. Or you can also say that the chair is made of atoms, the atoms are constantly changing, the electrons are constantly changing, so it is not permanent. But these are also our thoughts or ideas about it. This is some information that we received earlier. But this is not our experience, because we don’t feel it, we don’t really know it. We can only know something through our senses. If we felt it through our senses, then we know it. But you can’t say that about atoms; we don’t see or feel them. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, in fact, we must understand impermanence through </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ayatana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . What are ayatans, how many ayatans are there? Here we come again to a new Pali word "ayatana". Usually we say that ayatanas are sense organs, or spheres of perception: eye, ear, tongue, nose, body and mind (total six sense organs). And there are objects of the senses: the colors that we see with the eye; the smells we smell through our noses; sounds that we hear with the ear; tastes that we feel with the tongue; touches that we feel with our bodies. And then - the objects of the mind. Here are the six senses, the six spheres of perception. But in fact, these are 12 spheres of perception: the first 6 are internal ayatans, and the subsequent ones are external ayatans. If we need to understand what impermanence is, then we must see it through the ayatans. Then we can see: arises and disappears. As the Buddha said: “In the visible there should be simply the visible; in the audible there should be simply the audible; in the sensed there should be simply the sensed; in the realized there should be simply the realized” (Bahiya Sutta: Bahiya, Ud 1.10). In the visible there is only the visible, nothing remains. It appeared and disappeared. This is exactly what we should see. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's say, how exactly do we live now? In what concepts does our mind exist? At what level? At this level: I am sitting here, I have a body, I can see (because I have eyes). What can I see? What is in the world. What is accessible to my eye, I can see. This is: people, animals, different things, houses, nature and so on. We live with this understanding: “Everything that I see exists in the world. All that I can see are existing things. I see and I know that they exist.” This is the world we live in. Buddha explains that in reality this is not so, and the world is much deeper.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First level: Buddha says that the eye arises and disappears. Immediately after the moment the eye appeared, it disappears. When does the eye appear? The eye comes into existence the moment colors enter it. It is then that the consciousness of the eye arises: when there is the consciousness of the eye, the color and the “sensor” of the eye (or we can say the “base of the eye”). In Buddhism, we call this “sensor”, this “base” an eye, not an organ. This organ is a body because we can touch it. Buddha says that the eye cannot be touched, and we cannot see it either. You can see through the eye, but the eye itself cannot be seen. Therefore, it is not the same eye as a bodily organ. The eye we are talking about now arises when there are colors, when there is consciousness of the eye: it arises and immediately disappears. Why does it disappear? Because the color perceived by the eye is not constant. For a millisecond it appeared and then disappeared. Therefore, we must, through such understanding, and in fact through ourselves, see impermanence.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, let's say, sounds. When the ear perceives sound, then the ear and the consciousness of the ear arise. When we say “the ear perceives sound,” it seems as if the ear exists before the sound. But actually the Abhidhamma explains that three arise at once: when there is ear consciousness, then there is both sound and ear. If there is no ear, then there is no consciousness of the ear and no sounds. Also, if there are no sounds, then there is no ear and no consciousness of the ear. This is explained in the Abhidhamma. Then it also becomes clear to us that the ear is not this organ on the head. An organ is something related to the body because we can touch it. We will feel warmth, hardness, and so on - this is the whole body. But what perceives sound, a certain sensor, a basis, is what we call the ear. The ear appeared along with the sounds, and then disappeared.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now this is not the case for us. The ear exists because I also exist. I exist, the ear exists, and the sounds that we listen to also exist in the outside world. Because we don't usually listen to sounds. Right now, watch yourself - you are not listening to sounds, you are listening to me. Therefore, in your mind there is an idea that somewhere in distant Sri Lanka a monk lives in a monastery, and he is now giving a lecture there, and I am now here listening to him (or reading) - this is the world we have now. But in reality, what is happening to us now? I cannot explain the technology itself, but we can say that the phone perceives some signals, waves, converts them, and then plays sounds through the speakers. And then when the sound enters the ear, that’s when sound arises in the Buddhist understanding. It can be said that there is no sound without the ear. If there is no consciousness of the ear, then there are no sounds. It was as if a completely deaf person was sitting next to me - there would be no sounds for him. If he could hear before, then, probably, some perceptions of sounds are created in his mind, but if he has never been able to hear in this life, then sounds do not exist for him.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If someone’s “sensor”, or one might say the “base” of the nose, does not work, then there are no smells for him. It is unpleasant for us to go to a place where there is a very bad smell, for example, some toilet, but this does not happen to a person whose nose base does not work; for him there is no such trouble. If he sees that everything looks beautiful there, then for him it is a beautiful place. He doesn't have all this disgust because there are no smells.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look here: the sounds that arise - they immediately disappear. But if we do not have observation of the senses, there is no such level of awareness, there is no wisdom to see it, then it is for this reason that we see: there is a person there, he is reading something, they are singing something, and so on. That’s why we see and hear: there are different people there, dogs are barking, a plane is flying. And what we hear - for us it exists in the outside world. The car has passed, and now it is driving there, somewhere in the distance. The machine exists for us, and we call this existence “niccha”.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is "niccha"? This is consistency. Therefore, we have </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">niccha-sannya</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in our minds - the perception of permanence. Niccha-sannya means the vast multitude of perceptions in which we imagine permanence. This is as I explained at the beginning: this is not about the fact that the car will break down or may have an accident, it is not about such an understanding. This is about the fact that the machine exists, or the machine existed. When we say that the machine existed, then this is also constancy.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's like we can say: "I had a father and he died." That is, for me there is a dead father. I can remember him, I can do something in his honor. And why? Because for me my father exists. Which father? The dead father, the father who left, exists. But if we look at this through the ayatans, we will see that some thoughts and memories arise in the mind. And when these thoughts arise, if we do not have awareness and wisdom, then through the thoughts we will see some kind of father. And in our mind some concept arises that he is like this, he lived with us, he spoke to me like this, and so on. Therefore, if we need to see what anicca is, what impermanence is, then we must definitely observe ayatana. This is how we can see what impermanence is. We can see: the eye is fickle, colors are fickle; the ear is fickle, sounds are fickle; the nose is fickle, the smells are fickle; the tongue is fickle, tastes fickle; the body is impermanent, bodily sensations are impermanent; the mind is fickle, thoughts are fickle.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, now I can touch a chair, and it seems to me that I am touching the entire chair. But in fact, I can't touch the entire chair - I only touch some small place the size of my finger. This finger feels some kind of hardness, some kind of warmth, airiness - and that’s all, but a chair appears in the mind, and this is something completely different. Why does a chair appear in the mind? This is actually a very deep explanation. There is another Pali word: 
                   </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">asava</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , one might say - these are our savings, this is what we were taught in childhood. We were taught that this is a table, this is a chair, this is a chivara, this is a Buddhist monk, and these are headphones, and so on. This is all information that we collected, in which we believe. This is everything about the existence of which we have internal concepts.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It could be some kind of experience, some emotions associated with it that we experienced. All this also exists within us. Therefore, it may be that when a person sees some kind of creature, a spider, for example, even his body changes and he becomes very frightened. This is because there was already some other experience, because the person already perceived this being this way, and this experience remained inside. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I also have a concept: this is a chair. And how do I know this concept of “chair”? I was taught it. But not in childhood, as a child I was taught differently, the Sinhala word “putuwa”, but when I studied in Moscow. When I was learning Russian, I was taught that this is a “chair”, and the other is a “table”. This is how I was taught, and now I have this memory, and now when I see, I know: this is a “chair”. But in fact, I can only touch this touch: hardness, warmth, airiness. When we touch this warmth, airiness and hardness, the mind perceives this touch as a chair. And the eye works the same way. We see some colors: black, red; some forms, and when the eye perceives these colors and forms, the mind itself perceives: this is a monk, or some other creature, and so on.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And another concept arises in the mind. What concept arises? "This chair exists." “I can touch it, I can see it, I can buy it in the store,” and so on. Then a permanent object arose for us, or the perception of permanence, that the chair exists. Therefore, our world, the world around us, it exists. It does not appear and disappear, but exists. But in fact, all the time, every moment, through the eye, through the ear, through the nose, through the tongue, through the body, through the mind, the world arises and disappears, arises and disappears. But if we see impermanence, then we will not see this existing world, and this we call anicca. Then there is nothing left for us to remember, or hate, or love with all our might. Because we ourselves know that this is unrealistic.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not reality - it is some thoughts that arise in the mind, and due to ignorance we perceive them as permanent existing things in the external world, as people, as creatures, as animals, as anything else. We see them, love them, hate them, become attached, but in reality it all arises in the mind. It cannot be said that they all exist in the outside world. Then another question arises: “So they don’t exist”? We can say that these are two extremes. But the Teaching rejects both these extremes. “Exists” is wrong, “does not exist” is also wrong. Therefore, we cannot say “does not exist,” because if there is ignorance, if there is an eye, if there are colors, if there is consciousness of the eye, then all this arises for us. Everything arises from a person who has a mind and sense organs: for him the whole world exists. And because of the world, he worries, gets sick, lives and dies, is reborn, then lives and dies again. Because for him, when he dies, this world in which he lived remains, but he himself dies.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, my vision gets a little dark, and dark, and dark, and then I go completely blind and can’t see anything anymore. But it’s as if the world exists, but I can’t see it anymore. And during death, it’s as if a person’s eyes go blind, his ears go deaf, his nose stops smelling, his tongue stops tasting, his body stops feeling—everything stops working. But he understands: this world exists while I am dying. "How can I leave, how can I leave my loved ones?" He develops internal attachments, so his mind is bound </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to be reborn somewhere again because of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upadana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , because of clinging. Upadana is another important concept. But today we want to take a little closer look at what impermanence is, because it is one of the main concepts of the Buddha's Teachings.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Impermanence, anicca. The word "anicca" is formed from the word "nicca" and the prefix "a" adding negation. “Nicca” means permanence, “anicca” means impermanence. Even in Buddhist countries, sometimes it is misinterpreted, incorrectly explained, when they say that the word "anicca" is formed from "iccha": "what we desire." Then anicca is explained as that which should not be desired, but in fact it is taken from another place in the Teaching: it is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">subha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">asubha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , attractiveness and unattractiveness. Elsewhere in the Teaching it is explained why we do not need to desire peace. But here the Buddha directly says that anicca is impermanence, do not get confused. And when you hear the word anicca, you should understand: “Actually I don’t understand it.” How can we think about this wisely? “If I need to understand it, I must try to observe the senses, study deeply the Teachings of the Buddha. Only through this can I see this concept of impermanence.” 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then we have a goal, where to go, what to do. Just as if we want to get something from the depths, we must understand that our hand is not enough: we must take something in order to reach it, or think of something in order to get what we want. We must also understand that our wisdom is not yet enough, our knowledge is not yet enough to understand anicca.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Buddha says that there are three doors to Nibbana: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">animitta</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - signlessness, 
                   </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">appanihita</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - aimlessness, and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sunn&#257;ta</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - emptiness. One of the doors opens through impermanence, this door to Nibbana is called "animitta". Animitta means that if a person sees impermanence, then he has no nimitta left. Nimitta means objects, signs: what we saw, heard, felt, thought - different, different objects. Animitta means that a person no longer has the illusion that these objects exist in the external world. This concept no longer remains, because a person sees impermanence: he sees that some thoughts, memories arise in the mind, and disappear there. I saw it and it disappeared, I heard it and it disappeared, I smelled it and it disappeared, and so on. “In the visible there must be simply the visible; in the audible there must be simply the audible; in the sensible there must be simply the sensed; in the conscious there must be simply the perceived.” Therefore, seeing impermanence means approaching the Teachings of the Buddha; the door to Nibbana opens for such a person.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is very deep knowledge, deep Teaching. Therefore, we must slowly dismantle it. It is imperative that if we study it, then this Teaching gives us results. What result does the Teaching give us? The result is liberation. We can live on our own. Now we depend on the world, on people, on what they say, on what they may think. Our happiness, our joy depends on the world. But if a person understands the Dhamma, then he is freed from the world, because he sees: the world arises and disappears, the permanent world does not exist. This is exactly what anicca is.</font></font></font></div>

                  <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“In general, Kaccayana, this world is based on opposite [views] about existence and non-existence. When a person sees the emergence of the world in accordance with reality with correct wisdom, then [the idea of] “non-existence” in relation to the world does not arise in him. When he sees the cessation of the world in accordance with reality by correct wisdom, [the idea of] “existence” in relation to the world does not arise in him.”</font></font></i><br>

                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  How do we practice this? First of all, this practice begins with receiving the Teaching: this is a meeting with good friends, then listening to the Dhamma, then </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - thinking about the Dhamma, or wise meditation. Meditation on the Dhamma can be done if we know the Teaching, if we have no doubts about it. If we have doubts, then we must further analyze the Teaching and study it deeply. Let's say an eye, what is an eye? We must understand it completely. Because if we don’t know what Buddha explained about the eye, then we ourselves won’t be able to understand it. We will have our own wrong understanding, then we will think incorrectly, and therefore we will not have any result.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the very first thing is meeting with virtuous friends, the second is listening to the Dhamma, the third is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , wise reflection. We need to reflect on the information we received later. You need to think constantly. If we do not use our knowledge to practice </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , then we do not advance further. When we have any problem, any suffering, any grief, we must see it through these ayatans, since Buddha taught us the ayatans. Is this really what the Buddha explained to us? Does this Teaching work? We must understand everything through what the Buddha taught us, then little by little the Dhamma will be revealed to us. Then we can, at some level, pass this through our lives, and live as the Buddha explained to us.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We must understand what all this knowledge, all this thinking is for: to obtain the correct views. Gaining correct views does not mean that all our problems will be solved, that we will escape from all suffering. No, we just received the right views, and before that we did not know what truth and untruth were. But we still have the task of realizing this, of living like this. As the Sabbasava Sutta says: we must practice morality </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(sila)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , generosity </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
                  (dana)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , we must practice patience, we must avoid negativity, we must develop, educate our mind </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(bhavana)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . A variety of methods are described, and at the end there is also meditation, but the very first thing we must do is to obtain the correct information, this is the Teaching. And then you have to remember it, you have to remember it, you have to think about it. Not just repeat, but also analyze. Analyze through yourself, through your experience. Of course, mindfulness and repetition help for this, even repetition of Pali terminology helps. But at the same time, you need to constantly analyze it through yourself. Especially when some problems arise: we must take these Teachings of the Buddha, and through them we must analyze our problems. Then we can little by little see reality.</font></font></font></div>

                  For example, how can we use our right views to avoid anger? To do this, first of all we must see anger, that anger exists, that I am angry. We have to see it, and then through awareness we have to observe our anger: how it arises, how it exists. Because anger simply does not exist on its own: we must constantly feed it, support it, take care of it - it simply does not exist. We just don't know that we are supporting him, caring for him. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do we feed it? Let's say we have some kind of grievance. We remember this offense and think about it differently, reflect on it, and streams of different thoughts arise in the mind, and because of these thoughts, anger arises (the emotion of anger). This is unwise thinking, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ayoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Of course, when the emotion of anger arises, it is visible throughout the body: different sensations appear everywhere, some kind of discomfort appears, or even very strong discomfort, if it is hatred - strong misfortune.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I’m not talking about the initial moment of anger, because it doesn’t matter to us anymore. We now have anger and this is precisely the moment that is important to us. Do we have anger? Yes, I have. Do we support him? Yes, we support. How do we support it? We remember someone or something and think about it. Why do we think about this? Because the mind believes that it exists in the external world. And in practice, it doesn’t matter to us who it is, this case doesn’t matter to us, it doesn’t matter who did what, because the main thing here is ignorance. What ignorance? The mind believes that there is that object in the external world - this is our problem. The mind is sure that such a person exists in the external world. If we observe through the senses, then the mind will not see such a person in the external world, a person who has offended us. The mind sees thoughts. But it is not easy to implement what I am explaining to you. To do this, we must practice for a long time to see our anger as anger. Because we usually see anger as truth, as a person, as some kind of incident, as an insult. We see something else, we don't see anger. If we see anger as anger, then it ceases to exist - we cannot support it. If a person sees anger on a deep level, then he sees this emotion of anger and he does not support it. If he sees him through his senses, then he understands that such a person does not exist in the outer world (or in the inner world). It just appeared and disappeared, and now we are suffering. Why should we suffer if it doesn't exist? This will be wise reflection, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . If we are without awareness, without wisdom, then when anger arises in us, we feed it, support it, take care of it. But if we have awareness and we know the Teachings of the Buddha, then the first thing we want to do is get away from this suffering, we want not to suffer. If we see anger as anger, then the anger immediately disappears, goes out. If anger does not disappear, then we do not see anger as anger in reality - we see other people there, some situations, and so on.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can give the following example: let’s say some bandits surrounded me on the street and started beating me. If I knew a spell or something like that, so that I could cast it and disappear from there, I would immediately use it. Any person in such a situation, if he knew such a spell, he would immediately use it and disappear from there, because a person does not want to be beaten, does not want to suffer, and he has a way out, a place to go. We also constantly experience suffering. Like bandits, we have an eye, an ear, a nose, a tongue, a body and most importantly, a mind. They are like bandits - they beat us all the time, and we don’t know where to go, and we suffer here all the time. Just like if during a dream we hate someone, we are afraid, we suffer in a dream, then when we wake up, we do not want to see such a dream again. But even if we wanted to, we could not plunge into it again, because the mind does not perceive these as real events. For the mind this is no longer real.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">niccha-sannya</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , this perception of permanence, do? Because of him, being, existence </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(bhava)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> appears . For us there are permanently existing things because there is a perception of permanence in the mind. This is a very profound moment. If we see that for us home is permanent, Russia is permanent, Sri Lanka is permanent, I am permanent, then Russia exists, Sri Lanka exists, I exist. And also the whole world exists. The school we went to; the kindergarten we went to; university - everything exists. You can close your eyes and in an instant your mind remembers: yes, there, far away, in such and such a city he exists, or existed, or will exist. Time is not important, it is still existence, which means nichcha, constancy.</font></font></font></div>
