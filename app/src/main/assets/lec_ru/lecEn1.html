                  </font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We say that we want to go to nibbana, or when someone says: УI saw nibbanaФ - what does that mean? Many people try to see nibbana in meditation and think that nibbana is like some place, or like it is something material. They don't think in those words, but they actually have that understanding in their minds. As if we can go there and exist there, or that nibbana can be seen and after that we will understand it - some kind of understanding exists among people.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the Teaching does not describe such an understanding. One day the Venerable Sariputta, one of the Buddha's two chief disciples, was asked what Nibbana was. Venerable Sariputta said that nibbana is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ragakkhaino, dosakkhayo, mohakkhayo</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Nibbana is where there is no craving, no aversion and no ignorance. So first of all we must understand that nibbana is not a place.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Friend Sariputta, 'nibbana, nibbana' - that's what they say. What is nibbana?" </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

                  There is the achievement of nibbana during life ( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sa-upadi-sesa-nibbana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , i.e. Уnibbana with residual groups of existenceФ or simply Уnibbana with remainderФ) when a person achieves nibbana during life and continues to live. Then this person knows two realities - there is samsara, our life, and there is another reality - nibbana. The question arises: how, how can we recognize nibbana? Nibbana is the object of the mind: with the mind, with wisdom, we recognize Nibbana. This is called nibbana with remainder.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person has completely conquered his thirst, his hatred, his ignorance, he lives like a saint in this life, he has no evil left. Only goodness, compassion, only good qualities remain. And after death, such a person completely achieves nibbana ( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">an-upadi-sesa-nibbana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , i.e. Уnibbana without residual groups of existenceФ), for him there will be no samsara.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does it mean that there will be no samsara for him? There will be no samsara, which means there will be no suffering, and the absence of suffering is nibbana. And after his death, after the death of the arahat, the conqueror of all obscurations, he achieves nibbana, and this is called nibbana without a trace.</font></font></font></div>

                  To defeat defilements we practice the path to nibbana, for this we need to defeat all sankharas. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sabba sankhara samatho</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - pacification of all sankharas - this is nibbana. There are three types of sankharas: 
                   </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kusala abisankara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - good thoughts, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">akusala abisankara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                  - negative thoughts, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">aninjati sankharas</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - sankharas of high levels of samadi, jhanas. All of them keep a person in existence. When all sankharas disappear, this is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sabba sankhara samatho</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . But at the same time, a person retains kindness, compassion, and good qualities of mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people think that a person will become like a stone and will not feel anything. But in reality this is not so, because when we cleanse our mind of impurities, only the qualities that are in it by nature remain in the mind. And by nature the mind is kind. These qualities rise when we remove impurities. Otherwise it would be dangerous to meditate - we would become bad creatures, but this is not so. In fact, the nature of our mind is radiant, kind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After we were born, we began to deteriorate: thirst, pride, anger, envy - all this came later. In fact, we began to deteriorate already in our motherТs stomach. Therefore, we have an understanding that a child can be raised even when he is still in the motherТs belly: we must practice kindness, morality, develop good qualities of the mind - all this will be education for the child. But at the very beginning, before he has all the other senses, the child has the purest mind, the brightest mind, without defilements. Then, with the appearance of other senses, his mind becomes polluted.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same is true for a person who is freed from all defilements: he returns to a pure mind. But the difference between a child and an arahant is that the arahant has wisdom, and the child simply has not yet manifested ignorance.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is such a meditation called </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upasamanussati. </font></font></i> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Upasama</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                  means calm, tranquility, nibbana. If a person thinks about nibbana, then this is one of the 40 types of meditation described in the Teaching. But if a person has not achieved nibbana, how can he think about it? Even those who have achieved nibbana describe it very briefly: there are no words, no feelings, sensations, emotions. Buddha says: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">etan sanan, etan panitan</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . It is very peaceful, it is very pleasant, there is no sankhara, there is no defilement, there is no craving, no hatred, no ignorance. This is how Nibbana is described. But how can we think about this?</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think of it this way: we discussed that nibbana is the opposite of samsara, what is in samsara is not in nibbana. Therefore, if a person understands what is in samsara and the absence of this, then a person can understand a little (not achieve!) what nibbana is. If you think about nibbana correctly, then it will not frighten you: the mind will rejoice and calm down.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember my teacher was giving a three-day retreat and I was helping him. Those days I had a very bad headache, I could hardly do anything, I couldnТt sit, I couldnТt meditate. I thought about headaches and thought about nibbana: in nibbana there is no head, which means there is no headache there either, and there never will be. And not only is there no head, there is no body yet. So let's imagine: in nibbana there is no body. What does it mean? This means you donТt have to get up in the morning, donТt need to brush your teeth, go to the toilet, or have breakfast. If you donТt need to have breakfast, then you donТt need to cook, you donТt need to wash the dishes. If we really look at it this way, then we donТt need to drag our body around! We don't need a bed, table and chairs. And that means we don't need a house. If you donТt need a house, you donТt need to pay rent, you donТt need to take out loans, you donТt need to pay a mortgage. There is no need to sweep it, clean it, maintain it, repair it - all this requires effort. Even when a person goes somewhere far away on vacation, he takes his home with him. He has thoughts, and every thought about home requires strength - these are sankharas. If a person does not have these sankharas at all, then we can say that his </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sankhara is samatho</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : he does not develop sankharas. This is truly happiness.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no body, which means we donТt need to change our position. Why do we change posture? The body hurts and we suffer from it. If there is no body, it means it wonТt be there. And without the body there will be no disease. We get sick all the time, our organs get sick, our bones get sick, all kinds of viruses and disorders affect us. If a person thinks УI am not sick and will never get sick,Ф then he simply does not yet know what illnesses are. Buddha says that when we want to drink, eat, go to the toilet - these are all diseases. Bodily states change and something needs to be done about it. We are used to this, but in reality these are diseases of the body, and all this is suffering, every moment we suffer.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when there is no body, then suffering from the body also does not exist. This means you will never have a headache, a toothache, you will never be cold, you will never be hot, you will never have back pain. In reality, this is happiness. And this is the absolute achievement of nibbana.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you look at how many problems there are in the world, how many restrictions there are, there is nothing there. There is a world - that means there are countries. So many cultures, languages, religions. It seems to us that this is good, but it is good only when there are problems in order to solve them. But if there are no problems, then we donТt need all this.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems to us that money, houses, property are all happiness, but we need all this only in order to solve some of our issues. But if there is no question, we donТt need all this.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every time we think this way, for example, that there is no school, we need to imagine what a school is. How children go there, how they study, whether they want to go there, why they do it. These are not some complex doctrinal reflections, on the contrary. Otherwise, it would be possible to explain very quickly: in nibbana there is no mind and body, there is no </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nama-rupa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , thatТs the whole conversation. But this will not give the mind any understanding, it will not help us in any way, it will not be meditation. Therefore, we think very simply and consistently, we explain to the mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also no police, no judges. There are no buses or cars. No friends. If there are no friends, then there are no enemies. There are no relatives, which means there are no step-relatives either. There is no Sri Lanka, Russia, Buddhists, Christians, Muslims.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we start to think like this, we understand that there is freedom, there is liberation. And when we think like that, we think about the world, and we think that it is not there, it is not in nibbana.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's say there is no monastery. What does it mean? No need to go begging in the morning, no need to clean it up, no need to wash the dishes. There is no chivara, which means there is no need to repair or wash it. There is no sun, which means there will be no talk about whether it is cold or hot, as well as heat and cold. There are no religions there, which means there will be no my religion and someone elseТs religion, right and wrong views. Even such subtle thoughts actually bring us suffering. Even when we think that our Teaching is true and that it is good, even such thoughts bring us some kind of suffering. We must think this way, and then we will be able to imagine a little of what the Buddha was trying to explain to us.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, food is happiness. But if you look, why do we need food? Food is needed because there is hunger. I have a monk friend from Armenia, he told me this example. If a person was given the choice of either the ability to instantly receive any food he wanted or the opportunity to never be hungry or need food again, which would people choose? Almost all people would choose the first option. People eat not only for the sake of hunger, but also for taste, smell, and pleasure. But in reality, we need food to support the body, and if this need disappears, it will be happiness. To eat, you need to cook, for this you need to buy food, for this you need to earn money, for this you need to learn. It all starts in kindergarten. Therefore, if you look at reality, as much </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tanha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> as there is suffering.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are two Buddhist concepts: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mahichchhata</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">appicchhata</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . To have many desires or few desires. A person who practices the Teaching should have few desires, because when there are few desires, there are few problems. But we need to understand well that this does not necessarily somehow correlate with what a person has in this life. Maybe a person who has very little money and property, but a lot of thirst, and maybe itТs the other way around. We need to learn to be happy with what we have. Then we will always have enough and it will be easy for us. It will be easy for us to provide for ourselves, it will be easy to satisfy ourselves.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much money does it take to become rich? Buddha says that even if it rains gold, people's thirst will not disappear. A person is rich when he has enough and when he is happy about it. If a person always thinks about what he doesnТt have, then he is a poor person. In his world there is always a lack, he is always not enough, he is always lacking - so he cannot rejoice.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are now discussing nibbana to understand it a little, because even the slightest understanding of nibbana frees us from some level of our suffering. If a person approaches nibbana, his suffering decreases, the defilements of the mind decrease, and the good, good qualities of the mind increase. Therefore, we need to understand where to go, what it is.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take this example: the children have grown up and left home, and the mother misses them and suffers. We cannot tell a mother that she needs to free herself from attachment to her children in order not to suffer. This will not help her in any way; she cannot help but love her children. As long as she thinks that these are my children, she cannot free herself from this. Every time we say Уthis is mineФ, Уthis is mineФ - this means we have some kind of attachment. Therefore, if a person conquers himself, completely conquers his greed, he will have nothing of his own. What does it mean? Let's take a monk for example: he has his own monastery, his own teachers, his own religion, his own begging bowl, his own robe, his own country, his own language - so many things. And he can remember his relatives, his parents - how much a monk has! What does it mean? When we say that an arahant has nothing, does he have nothing? He has no clinging. The things we think exist around us and our clinging to them are two different things. Attachment is pollution. If you really look at it, a person has very few needs: clothing, housing, food and medicine. Everything else is related to thirst.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's go back to the example of the mother: how can she overcome her suffering? The only way for her not to love her children is for her to never have children, but she already has them. Attachment goes away only when a person gains wisdom, or in other words, when ignorance goes away. If there is ignorance, clinging cannot be defeated. Therefore, the Teaching explains how we can overcome our ignorance.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ignorance has two tasks: it covers reality and we see something else instead of reality, we see an illusion. It is as if a man is lost in the desert, thirsty, and sees a mirage in the distance. Ignorance blocks reality from him: he does not see that there is actually no water there. And it seems to him that there is water there. That's why he strives there.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we have ignorance, we get lost in this world, we think: this body is mine, this house is mine, this is my country, my property, my children and so on. We have a lot of things, a lot of acquisitions. But if you look at it in reality, this body is nobodyТs, it doesnТt belong to anyone. The body is a piece of earth, and will become earth again. The body arose in the mother's belly: a cell arose and it developed thanks to the nutrition it received from the mother. And then we started feeding ourselves. This is all food, and food belongs to the earth, so our body came from food, and the body is also earth, and one day we will become earth. If a person thinks correctly, he will experience less suffering from the body. Because he understands that this body is not mine, not me, this body will have to be left. And this very УIФ appears in the mind, it appears where there is ignorance.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does ignorance arise? It comes from misunderstanding, from wrong information. We don't understand what's really happening now. Because of this, every person has some level of ignorance.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does ignorance arise? The eye actually perceives only colors and colors. And without colors the eye cannot exist. The eye, the colors and the consciousness of the eye arise together and disappear together. This is the reality of the vision. This means when I say that I see you, in fact I do not see anything in the world, because the vision will happen in my mind, not in the world. As if I look at the screen and think that there is someone there. But when we look at the screen, we understand that some colors are simply burning there, and from this a vision appears, but there is no one on the screen.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I heard that in the very beginning, when movie theaters came out, people were scared when they saw a train going there, because they thought that they were actually going to get hit by a train. This was also some level of ignorance, but now we donТt have this ignorance, and we are not afraid.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We also need to understand that vision will occur in the mind, so when I say that there is a person there, it is the mind that tells me, not the eye. These are two organs, two spheres of perception: one perceives colors, and the other perceives thoughts, concepts, objects, ideas. When I say that there is a person there, then this is already the work of the mind, not the work of the eye. When I touch something, what am I touching? The mind says: what you see is what you touch. For example, a cup. But what is it really? In reality, I only touch warmth, hardness, pressure - this is another reality: there are no colors, there is no cup, there is no beauty. This is what it means to live - our sense organs work: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. And we can say that the mind is in the middle: it connects all the organs and wants to understand what the world is.</font></font></font></div>

                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like a child at the very beginning of his life: he cannot focus his vision on any object, so his world is divided into colors. Then the child begins to focus his eyes on one particular shape. And then he touches, and thinks that what he sees is what he touches - and immediately external objects appear, attachments appear. This is how ignorance manifests itself that there are such people, creatures, things, and some of them are mine. This is how we learned, and this is how our thirst, our attachments began. And we don't know what reality really is. Reality is the work of our senses. Apart from our six senses and their objects, there is nothing else.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eye and eye objects, ear and ear objects, nose and nose objects, tongue and tongue objects, body and body objects, mind and mind objects. What is there besides this? There can be two answers: nibbana is, and there is nothing. But in fact, when we say that nibbana is, then nibbana is an object of the mind. But when a person has no thirst, when he does not need to exist, he will not have samsara. What is samsara? These are precisely </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the ayatans</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the spheres of perception.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We need to deeply understand the Teaching. There is no need to imagine nibbana somewhere. Just think as Buddha said: Nibbana is where there is no craving, where there is no hatred, where there is no ignorance, where there is no pollution. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you need to imagine nibbana, then you can simply imagine samsara, and think that this is not in nibbana. Then, because of your thirst, no fear appears in your mind: what is there, what will be there. When we say "what will happen there?" Ц this is our thirst. When we think that this means УI wonТt be there and why then do I need thisФ - then this is our thirst speaking in us, our ignorance. Now I am also not there, but there is ignorance, and through ignorance УIФ appears.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we suffer, we can imagine this peace, this happiness. Here we suffer, and when a person suffers, he can see his clinging, and that when there is no clinging, there is peace. This peace must be seen.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people think that samsara is bad, but somewhere there is another place where we can exist forever, live forever, rejoice all the time. But people donТt understand that this is again our </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tanha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , our thirst, our ignorance, and this will not bring us happiness.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The shortest description of Nibbana is where there is no craving, where there is no ignorance, where there is no anger, no hatred. Some things are difficult to understand, and in fact, nibbana cannot be explained in any other way, because there is a different reality, there are no words, and we donТt have enough words to explain nibbana. If words are samsara, then nibbana is not words, there are no words, it is another reality. But we must understand that there is no samsara there.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person understands how ignorance actually creates the world, then he can overcome ignorance. Ignorance can be overcome through understanding the spheres of perception (through understanding your senses). To do this, you need to develop your morality, concentration, calmness, composure of mind, and develop your wisdom. This is a long work, but if a person practices this Path, then as a result his suffering will certainly decrease, because we are going to the non-suffering. Where there is no suffering, this is nibbana.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that when a person becomes an arahant, all clinging to himself and to other beings goes away, but compassion does not go away, because there is absolute reality and relative reality. Only fully enlightened beings see absolute reality, the reality we have just discussed. And for them there are no beings, no ignorance. But people live in relative reality, and there they see other beings. And the arahant understands that others have ignorance, and for them samsara continues, so compassion remains with him. These are simply different types of understanding.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, cats live in a monastery, but there is no monastery for cats - they donТt have such ideas. But for monks, there are cats, and we take care of them.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And again, these are human pure qualities: kindness, compassion - thatТs why they remain.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We exist in samsara because of ignorance, and with ignorance comes other defilements. Therefore, we have a desire to exist, a thirst to be - this is our thirst, we ourselves want it. If she leaves completely, what will remain? As long as the mind is working, we will live, and then there can be no existence. The Buddha explained that existence arises from ignorance.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have practiced </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upamanussati</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> as I told you, and I practice vipassana. I actually havenТt read anywhere about this particular practice, but in fact, the entire BuddhaТs Teaching is about this. The teaching tells us that everything that exists in the world is not in nibbana, and it can be achieved here, during life. I want to overcome my thirst and my ignorance, and I see some of my current level of thirst and ignorance, and I practice. And when the thirst gradually decreases, I understand where I am going. People think that nibbana is a place, but actually we have to fight our ignorance and overcome it. We need to realize nibbana, but we donТt need to be aware of nibbana, we need to be aware of samsara, our suffering. If we understand that we have a problem, and the problem itself, then we can solve it. And if a person thinks that everything is fine with him and there are no problems, such a person will not need the Teaching. The teaching is needed only by those who see the problem, who see suffering. This is how I think about nibbana, how I understand it.</font></font></font></div>
