We begin our practice with samatha, focusing on the object of awareness: observing the body, breathing, and so on. And then we move on to Vipassana. Samatha helps us keep the mind calm, relaxed, develop one-pointedness of mind, concentration, concentration, and so on. Vipassana helps us understand the world as it really is, to understand reality. To understand the world we need a theory that needs to be used in practice. To do this, the Buddha explains to us the six ayatanas: the six senses or six spheres of perception. What are these ayatans?</font></font></font> 
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  1. Eye and colors. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  2. Ear and sounds. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  3. Nose and smells. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  4. Language and tastes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

                  6. Mind and objects of mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  They can be called ayatans, or we can say that this is our world. When we say that we live, what do we mean? That we use these six senses. You may wonder if we know anything other than these six verses? Try to really think about it yourself.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But so far we donТt even know what our eye is. We are only familiar with the idea of &#8203;&#8203;the eye that was passed on to us by our parents and school. But in the Teaching of the Buddha another eye is described: in the Teaching of the eye (ayatana of the eye) it arises when there are reasons and disappears when there are no reasons. And the eye cannot be touched, it cannot be seen, such an eye is explained in the Teaching. And then it is clear that our worldly concept of the eye does not quite coincide with what the Buddha explains to us. ItТs the same with the ear, nose, tongue: they too cannot be seen or touched. We can only touch the body, but at the same time the body is also inaccessible to vision - we cannot see it.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now this sounds like some kind of mystery to us. Let's figure out what this means. We know that somewhere inside our eye there is some kind of sensor. But in fact, it is only there for us when there is color. When some colors enter our eye, then vision begins.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
                  Buddha says: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cakkhunca paticca rupe ca uppadjati cakkhuvinnyanan</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . When color enters the eye, eye consciousness arises. This is how vision happens. And only when these three elements are present - the eye, the colors and the consciousness of the eye - does contact </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(phassa)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> arise . Two are not enough for contact to occur. If there is just an eye and colors, there is no contact, since the consciousness of the eye also needs to be there. If one of these three is missing - the basis, the object or consciousness, then nothing arises in our mind, and we donТt know about it, it doesnТt exist for us. For example, this happens during an operation under anesthesia or after anesthesia: we can touch some part of the body, there is a body (base) and there are touches (objects), but body consciousness does not arise. Or when we are in complete darkness: there are no colors, so we do not have vision.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are the objects of the eye? These are the colors. Can't perceive anything other than eye colors. We even taught this at school. And these colors are also fickle. The colors enter the eye, the consciousness of the eye appears, these three elements - the eye, the colors and the consciousness of the eye - arise and immediately disappear.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's now look at the ear. What does the ear perceive? Sounds. Now it seems to us that we know and understand all this, but our obscurations are so great that in fact we do not see all this. Our ignorance is invisible to us. In fact, we never perceive sounds directly. What do we hear? We hear the wind, the bus, people, but not sounds, because our mind is already darkened: we have a huge amount of information, all our past life experience. We can say that the mind, in a sense, is already programmed and this program cannot be changed. Now, when you listen to this, you don't hear sounds, you hear speech. If you listen to speech in a language that you know, then you cannot help but hear the words. For example, the word УmotherФ has four sounds, but we donТt hear them, we hear the whole word at once. In fact, when we hear words, some concepts, concepts immediately appear in our minds. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nose perceives smells. The tongue perceives tastes. The body perceives touch. Touch is hardness, warmth and pressure, everything that we can touch. What does the mind perceive? Objects of the mind. These are sensations, perceptions, some thoughts - this is what the mind perceives.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Buddha's Teaching explains that more than one ayatana cannot work at a time. If the ayatana of the eye works, then the ayatana of the ear does not work. Now it seems to us as if everything is working at the same time, but this is because our mind works very quickly. In fact, this is not so: at any given moment only one ayatana can work, because in fact our mind is one, and consciousness is one, and it arises and disappears all the time. When it arises in the ayatan of the eye (or we can say from the base of the eye), it does not arise in the ayatan of the ear and in the rest of the ayatans. So it arises and disappears all the time.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Bhikkhus, consciousness is considered on the basis of a certain condition depending on which it arises. When consciousness arises depending on the eye and forms, it is considered as eye consciousness. When consciousness arises depending on the ear and sounds, it is considered as ear consciousness. When consciousness arises depending on the nose and smells, it is considered as nose consciousness. When consciousness arises depending on the tongue and tastes, it is considered as language consciousness. When consciousness arises depending on the body and tangible things, it is considered as body consciousness. arises depending on the mind and mental phenomena, it is considered as the consciousness of the mind. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  [This] is similar to how fire is considered based on a certain condition, depending on which it burns. When a fire burns depending on the logs, it is considered the fire of the logs. fire burns depending on the bundle of brushwood, it is considered to be fire of the bundle of brushwood. When fire burns depending on the grass, it is considered to be grass fire. When fire burns depending on cow dung, it is considered to be cow dung fire. When a fire burns depending on the hay, it is considered a hay fire. When a fire burns depending on debris, it is considered a debris fire. In the same way, consciousness is considered on the basis of a certain condition, depending on which it arises. When consciousness arises depending on the eye... When consciousness arises depending on the mind and mental phenomena, it is considered as mind-consciousness."</font></font></i><br>

                  Let's look at an example of how things work when we saw something. Some colors entered the eye, consciousness arose at the base of the eye. What happens after consciousness arises at the base of the eye? After this, depending on the eye consciousness, the mind consciousness arises and the mind cognizes the eye consciousness that has arisen. At this point we had two different contacts.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are two types of contact: the first is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Patighasamphassa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (impact contact), when contact occurs with objects of the eye, ear, nose, tongue or body. We can say that this is the primary physical contact. After this, these consciousnesses (eye, ear, nose, tongue or body) disappear, and immediately this information is perceived by the mind, and contact arises again - contact with the mind. This second contact is called 
                   </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adhivachanasamphassa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (designation contact): internal mental contact.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If something arose in our mind on the basis of visual perception, it means that the colors entered the eye and the consciousness of the eye arose - there was a first type of contact, and on its basis a second type of contact arose, and something arose in our mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"></div>
                <div class="a"></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also on the basis of the mind the following consciousness of the mind can arise. For this we also need three elements: the mind, the objects of the mind and the consciousness of the mind. And when the consciousness of the mind arises on the basis of the consciousness of the mind, we say that thinking occurs.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Besides these sense organs, we actually donТt know anything else and never have known. We know what we see, what we hear, what we smell, what we taste, what we touch, what we think. That's all we know. Since we were born in the human world and have human eyes, we perceive only what is accessible to our senses. For example, there are creatures that can see temperature - this is not possible for us. Or there are creatures whose vision is black and white - all the other colors that we see are inaccessible to them. In fact, we are happy creatures, it takes a lot of merit to be born as a human, so we see all this beauty, but not all creatures are like that.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here's an example: we see a cat, and for us it is beautiful, fluffy, pleasant, affectionate. But imagine if we were born mice. The cat would be a terrifying sight for us, perhaps the last in our lives. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You have dogs and cats at home Ц they exist in our world. But there are no people in their world, we donТt know how they see us, how they represent us. There are a variety of animals in our world, but we donТt know what is in their worlds.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are only certain colors available to us that we can perceive when they enter the eye. The next thing we must understand is that vision occurs at the base of the eye (one might say, in the ayatana of the eye), and not somewhere else, in the external world. After this, this information is perceived by the mind, and the mind already recognizes what it sees. Definitions are not given by the eye, definitions are given by the mind. How does the mind recognize this? The mind uses its knowledge, its experience, and thanks to it determines what it sees.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person were born in the forest, and he had no parents, then there would be no one to pass on human knowledge to him. Without this knowledge, we would be just animals: we would not know how to stand, walk, talk. If we never heard language, we could not speak. If there were no language in the mind, we could not think. Without language, our thinking would be limited to emotions and images. Language is necessary for structured and logical thinking within an orderly system. For this reason, Buddha reused the words that existed at that time and endowed them with his own meanings - he created new concepts, new terms, new definitions, a new conceptual apparatus. In order to understand the world, we need good language so that we can reflect and understand. It is precisely for this reason that we study it: we study the Pali, the suttas, we study the Teachings of the Buddha, using that language.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The eye sees color, eye consciousness arises, after eye consciousness arises mind consciousness. And this is the consciousness of the eye as an object for the consciousness of the mind. And when the consciousness of the mind arises, we recognize something: here comes a person, here comes a bus, and so on. And after this comes our thinking, and we begin to think about it. And this is called </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kamma</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Mental </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sankharas</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or mental kamma. Now we are sitting, meditating, and it doesnТt matter whether we know about it or not - we are creating new kamma.</font></font><br>

                  The ear works in the same way: when sound enters the ear, the consciousness of the ear arises, then the consciousness of the mind arises, and some concepts arise in the mind. It all comes in a constant stream. And we live in these concepts. Of course, there are all sorts of objects around us, and materiality in general, but how we perceive it is all a task of the mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now our task is to develop our concentration, awareness and wisdom in order to understand what reality is, in order to see the world as it is. To do this, first of all, you need to understand what deception is, what delusions are, what ignorance is. Ignorance actually arises in the mind, and we need to see this ignorance at least a little, recognize it in ourselves, only then will correct views arise.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's say I see a table. How is the table perceived? The color enters the eye, the consciousness of the eye arises. They arise together and disappear together. Based on the consciousness of the eye, the consciousness of the mind arises, the mind says: УHere, there is a table.Ф Then I can touch the table. Thus, contact occurs: the eye has seen the table, I can touch this table; This is how our world comes into being. But in fact, I was not touching the table, I was touching hardness, warmth, pressure. And I didnТt see the table, I saw the colors. But I live in a world in which a table exists.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, for example, an apple. I can smell it, I can touch it, I can taste it, I can think about it. And an apple appears in my world. This is how everything constantly arises and disappears, and this is how our world arises. And what else is missing in our world. And we say: our world has arisen and it exists, it exists. And then we see some kind of permanent world. We don't see impermanence, we see something permanent. Sri Lanka - yes? Eat. Is there an ocean? Eat? Was Buddha in our world? Was. Since it was there, it means it was permanent. All these objects are permanent for us. Therefore, the very first thing we learn in the Teaching is impermanence. If we actually know what impermanence is, it will be a supramundane understanding.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a worldly understanding of impermanence. For example, itТs as if the pen is fickle: I can write with it for a while, then it runs out and wonТt write anymore. But this is not impermanence, because the constant handle is there, the concept УhandleФ is there, I can touch the handle, I can see the handle. And therefore we are in a world where there are pens, and therefore this is the worldly understanding of impermanence. But if we see that a pen appears and disappears when I touch it, when I see it, when I think about it, then this will be a supramundane concept. Vipassana leads exactly there, to the vision </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">of anicca</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                  - impermanence, to the vision of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">anatta</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - selflessness.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is best to use Pali terms, because we can translate "anatta" as impersonality, and as selflessness, and as the absence of a permanent self, the absence of a soul. But I donТt know how you understand these concepts - УIФ, УpersonalityФ, УsoulФ, because a word is a sound that enters the ear, and what you perceive after that, I donТt know, it depends on your knowledge, from your experience, from your understanding. It all depends on your individual understanding of these concepts. Therefore, it is best to say "anatta". One word in other languages &#8203;&#8203;will not be able to reflect the full depth of these concepts, so it is best to form your own understanding of the key concepts of the Teaching so that you do not need translations.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we need to first know the correct descriptions that the Buddha gave us, study them, and then we need to think carefully about it ourselves, see it for ourselves. For example, we know what hardness is, what warmth is, what colors are - for this we donТt need any special word or special concept, we know what it is.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we do not see impermanence, then due to this ignorance existence, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bhava,</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> arises . How does it arise? Now we heard a sound as if some metal object had fallen in the distance. For us, there is metal there somewhere, and it fell somewhere. There is already such a concept, such an existence. And we have countless such concepts in our minds: our relatives, our relatives, our friends, our enemies, our property, our favorite things, our country, other countries, pleasant and unpleasant animals - they all exist, all this exists. Where does all this exist? It all exists with us right now, so we have no liberation. But we want to be free, we want to be happy. How can there be happiness when there are enemies? When are there wars? What happiness is it when our relatives get sick, grow old, and die? We cannot free ourselves from this. And wherever you go, you go with your baggage - your world. Wherever you go, you always take your world with you, and there will be no liberation there, there will again be a prison of habitual ideas.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Buddha says that the most important thing in the Teaching is the taste of liberation. У </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as the ocean has one taste: the taste of salt, so in the same way, this Teaching and Discipline has one taste: the taste of liberationФ</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (Uposatha, </font></font><a href="https://theravada.ru/Teaching/Canon/Suttanta/Texts/ud5_5-uposatha-sutta-sv.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Udana 5.5</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). That is why we value the Teachings of the Buddha so much, that is why we revere him so much. When we begin a lecture or meditation, at the beginning we say: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhasa,</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                  which means: УGlory to the Blessed One, the Perfect One, the Fully Enlightened One.Ф We express our respect and gratitude. We revere Buddha because he taught us how to be free, how to be happy. Without him, without his Teaching, there would be no liberation for us.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we are in the human world, and this is not the worst thing. We are very good here, but it wonТt always be so good, and we donТt know where we will go next. We can be reborn in the world of hungry ghosts, in the world of evil spirits, in hells, in the animal world. As long as there are obscurations in our consciousness, there is ignorance, it always leads somewhere, connects with something, it needs constant existence. It never wants to stop existing: it always wants to see, hear, feel, so it constantly exists. But this is where this existence leads Ц itТs scary.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We donТt know what will happen after death, but we know that we live and for now we have suffering: we are all born, grow old, get sick, die, we experience separations from the pleasant, encounters with the unpleasant, failure to get what we want. In order to free ourselves from this suffering, we need to know what reality is, and this is precisely why we need practice.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not just abstract knowledge, we must use it in practice, see it in our own experience. How exactly to practice? Now we sit, concentrate on the object of awareness and meditate. During the process of meditation, we hear some sounds, when we hear sounds, the ear and some objects appear that we hear. For example, a monkey that is somewhere in the distance. And for us now the monkey exists there. We must take this object - the monkey - and do Vipassana: look in reverse order at what actually happened. There was a sound and a monkey appeared in the mind, but after that the mind moves on, the mind begins to think about it. You can observe how the mind continues to spin this thought, thinks about the monkey, and different thoughts arise in it.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do we say that we need a quiet place to meditate? Even when some kind of sound constantly enters the ear, in fact it does not even last a second - it immediately disappears. But after that, the mind begins to think about it and it is unpleasant for us, because we are not meditating, but thinking about these sounds. And what do we think? Now, if there werenТt this monkey, there werenТt these sounds, there wouldnТt be this music - then I would meditate well. But this is also thirst, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tanha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . ItТs just </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">vibhava tanha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - the desire for something not to exist, for something not to be. Or maybe we hear some sounds that are pleasant to us, for example, birdsong or music. Then we have </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kama tanha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - a thirst for this, a desire for this, a thirst to see, hear, feel this and so on.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we meditate and sounds, touches and something else appear, we need not to be deceived by them, not to get lost there. We need to understand reality, because we live in a huge deception, in an illusion. And if at least once we see what reality is, then we will know: there is reality and there is deception. If we donТt know what reality is, then all we have is this deception. ItТs as if we were born in an egg: until we hatch from it, until we break the shell, we donТt know what the world is, we only know the shell. We have an example in Sri Lanka - a frog born in a deep well. She was born in it, lives in it, has seen nothing but a well, and this is her world. Likewise, our world is the colors that we see, the sounds that we hear, as well as smells, tastes, touches, and our concepts that other people (parents, friends, relatives, teachers, society) have given us, and concepts which we ourselves created. This is our world.</font></font><br>

                <div class="a"><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Blessed One said: УWhat is 'all'? [It is] the eye and forms, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and tactile sensations, mind and mental phenomena. This, monks, is called 'all'. And if If someone says: УHaving rejected this 'everything', I will describe another 'everything' - then on his part it will only be empty boasting. If he were questioned [on this matter], he would not be able to answer and would only be met with annoyance. Why? Because it is outside his realm [of knowledge]."</font></font></font></i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

                  Here are some examples so you can understand what this deception is. Let's say there is a dining room for us over there. She is there, she exists. Why do we say that it is there? Because we can go there and look at it, touch it, and it will be there. This means there is a permanent dining room for us there. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do we understand that this is not so, that this is impermanence, anicca? There are different examples for this, one of them is a mirror. We get up in the morning, go to the mirror, see our reflection, wash ourselves, and then leave. But we do not have the concept in our minds that there is some kind of separate face in the mirror, that we left, but it remained there. We know that the mirror only reflects color, and we understand that as soon as we are gone, our reflection is no longer there. How do we understand this? With the help of logic, with the help of our mind. But if a monkey comes up to the mirror and sees its reflection, it will decide that there is another monkey there, and will begin to have a showdown with it. And then, when the monkey leaves, it will remain in its mind with the understanding that there is another monkey left in the room, that it is there. And when she comes to this room again, the second monkey will be there again.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our monastery in Kandy there is a tuk-tuk parked in the morning. And every morning the same little bird flies to him, sits in front of the mirror and begins to peck at him. And he does this for a while because he thinks there is another bird there and he wants to free it. Then she gets tired and flies away, but returns every time the next morning. In her mind, in her world, there is another bird there, and she remembers it.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So are we. Now you have arrived in Sri Lanka, but your home country remains somewhere there, it is there. And then when you fly back, your country will be there. And there will be the country that you know. And in fact, you donТt know how to see a new country, and you wonТt have a new country. For you there will be a past country, already familiar to you, which you know.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some say that our world is bad - and for them there will be a bad world. Some say that Sri Lanka has terrible nature, dangerous, and for them there will be terrible and dangerous nature, because what we have in our minds is what we see in our world.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or another example: we are now sitting in the hall. The hall is big enough, we can walk around it and check it out. But in reality we wonТt feel the hall. I can only feel this small spot that I touch, I will only feel this hardness on which my legs rest, the temperature, the pressure. But when I look, the hall entirely exists for me.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as a monkey sees his reflection in the mirror, and thinks that there is some kind of separate monkey in the mirror, so do we: we see reflections of our mind all the time, and we think that these reflections really exist, and we try to do something with them . As long as we believe in this, we will not be freed from attachment to them, from suffering, from the world. We need to learn to see our thoughts as thoughts.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now all this information for you is just some kind of abstract knowledge, but you can check it: figure it out yourself, run it through your experience, try it - it will really be like that. Look at this painting on the entire wall at the end of the hall: we see lotuses, water, mountains behind, the Bodhi tree, the sky. But we cannot see the wall at the same time. If we see the wall, then we do not see the picture. We cannot perceive both the picture and the wall at the same time, because at one moment in time one perception arises. There are actually no lotuses on this wall, but we see them, and why can we see them? Because we have some images in our minds for this, some pictures, and when they coincide with our vision, then we perceive them that way. Or there is a black and white picture in which you can see either two black silhouettes of a face looking at each other, or a white vase. What the mind recognizes in these colors is what we see. Nowadays they draw such realistic three-dimensional graphics that when we see them, we cannot distinguish them from photographs. This is how our mind deceives us.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our task is to separate these senses. We constantly connect our senses: what I saw is what I think about, and this is what I listen to, this is what I touch. But now we need to separate this and understand that in reality I am touching - these are objects of the body, touching. And I listen to the objects of the ear - sounds, I see the objects of the eye - colors, and so on. And what we think about are the objects of the mind. This topic is very deep, very difficult.</font></font></font></div>

                  And correct thinking is very important for us to meditate. You need to understand how to think and how not to think, what the results will be if I think like that, because the results we get depend on how we think. Let's say I think that I am a bad monk: УI know so little, I keep my vows poorly, I practice poorly.Ф Or I think: УI am an excellent monk, educated, I know so much, I practice so well.Ф No matter how I think, some qualities arise in the mind, and we need to understand this. Both of these thoughts are given by pride, itТs just that the first one is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hinamana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , lower pride, but the thought that I am worse than everyone else is also pride.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, letТs say, some person accused us of something. We begin to think about this person: УHow did he just accuse me so easily, why didnТt he check himself before that?Ф And what happens in the mind at this time: we develop ill will. And whether it continues to grow or not depends on whether we continue to think this way or not. The concept of pride, conceit, is also very deep; conceit disappears only upon achieving arahatship. As long as we believe that we have an УI,Ф we will have pride. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now we need to understand how to think correctly, how to direct our thinking, because we are constantly thinking. Let's say you sit, meditate and think that something is not working out for you. If you start to think: УI tried so hard, but I canТt do it, I probably wonТt succeed, IТll probably never succeed, I donТt know how to meditate,Ф then what will happen next? First of all, there will be tension, worries, there will be no joy. And these thoughts will not help you develop your mind, develop your meditation, so it is important for us to correctly direct our thinking.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How should you think? УItТs good that I came, itТs good that I study the Dhamma, itТs good that I practice. So many people who have the desire and aspiration to practice do not even know about it. So many people suffer and do not know the Path to liberation from suffering, not met the Dhamma, and I was so lucky and I met with good friends, I can study the Dhamma. And since I meditate, I develop patience, I make an effort, I develop all these qualities, so it cannot be said that I fail.Ф If you think like this, your mind will gradually calm down and develop further.

                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we constantly need to see our thoughts and know where they are going and where we need to direct them. If we do not know this direction where we need to direct our thinking, we will not be able to use the Teaching. This is also </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . This is also a very deep concept. Therefore, the Buddha said that his Teachings are useful only to those who know how to think wisely.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we hear some unpleasant sound, we immediately feel some kind of disgust, some kind of ill will. Where did this ill will come from? It was not the sound that conveyed it to me, the sound was simply heard, there was no unpleasantness in the sound, but ill will appeared in the mind. When we begin to think this way, ill will goes away, and instead we begin to develop wisdom and awareness. This is exactly </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the way to think. We need to constantly see our thinking and direct it correctly - this is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some people think that meditation is stopping thinking, that the purpose of meditation is not to think. This is a very erroneous concept. The purpose of meditation is to train the mind. The word </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bhavana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is translated as УmeditationФ; it can also be translated as Уculture of the mindФ, Уdevelopment of the mindФ, Уeducation of the mindФ. If not literally, then we can also say that </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bhavana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is the art of the mind. We need to find out what the mind is and properly educate and develop it so that it does not get lost and deceived.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are states of mind in which there is no thinking, but the Buddha never encouraged such states of mind, he said that we should not become attached to such states of mind and that they will not be useful to us. We need to correct our views, we need to get rid of the thinking born of ignorance, and not just suppress our ability to think. A good mind is a calm and active mind, it can maintain balance. Therefore, we practice awareness and concentration, and also when we need to, we think correctly. Buddha explained the theory to us, and we use it when we think, because we ourselves would get lost there.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ask any person what he sees? He will say that he sees a house, people, animals, because we have seen this since childhood, touched it, and so on, we have taught this since birth. To understand this deception, we must first learn it from someone. And these are told by those who heard it from the Buddha, so we need the Teachings of the Buddha. This is how the BuddhaТs Teaching has reached our days, thanks to good friends, thanks to the people who preserved it and passed it on.</font></font></font></div>

                  <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then Monk Ananda came up to me, bowed, sat down next to me and said: УDear one, this is half the holy life - that is, good friends, good companions, good comrades.Ф </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  When this was said, great king, I answered the monk Ananda: УIt is not so, Ananda! It is not so, Ananda! This is the entire holy life, Ananda - that is, good friends, good companions, good comrades. When a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good companion, then one can expect him to develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path</font></font></i><br>

                  We must develop awareness and concentration, and we must observe our mind and direct it in the right direction. These reflections do not prevent us from developing </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">samadhi</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (concentration, tranquility and concentration); on the contrary, they greatly help to deepen it.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if anger arises in you, you can understand that there is nothing there anymore: the sounds have already disappeared, and it is I myself who are spinning thoughts in my mind. IТm doing this myself now, it makes me feel bad, IТm harming myself. And then you can quickly let it go, but this requires wisdom, you need to develop your mind.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This may not be possible right away, but it is necessary to nurture and develop your mind by learning, reflecting and constantly applying these teachings. It is important that this knowledge passes into our experience, so that it does not become just another piece of information in addition to what we already have, but becomes part of our perception of the world. We need to learn to see the world this way.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Teaching says that there are several levels of knowledge. </font></font><br>
                  <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  1. The first level is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">suthamaya nana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : you need to learn about it (hear about it, or read about it). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  2. The second level is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">chhintamaya nana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : knowledge through deliberation. 
                   </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  3. The third level is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bhavanamaya nana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : knowledge through vision, through oneТs experience.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                  First we have to learn about it, then we have to learn it and think about it, then we have to see it. All the knowledge we receive here is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">suthamaya nana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . When we meditate, when we develop our mind, we need to use this knowledge.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what is consciousness? The task of consciousness is to know something. And what does consciousness know? What arises in the mind is what it knows. For example, we see a branch and mistake it for a snake. The mental object УsnakeФ immediately arises in the mind and consciousness cognizes the snake. Then we see that it was a branch, the mental object УbranchФ arises in the mind, and consciousness cognizes the branch. The mind can think logically and understand that there was no snake there, and all this time there was a branch there, that we made a mistake, but these are objects of the mind, this is how thinking works. Consciousness doesnТt work like thatЧconsciousness only cognizes.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We cannot see the consciousness of the eye itself; our awareness and concentration are not enough for this. The consciousness of the eye could be seen by the Buddha, and the Buddha gave us the Teaching so that through the Teaching we could know what is happening and see the deception. Because the consciousness of the eye perceives only colors, or some images, forms. And this information is perceived by the mind, and the mind already perceives these flowers as a dog, as a person, and so on. And this all happens in a continuous stream, very, very quickly, so it is very difficult for us not to be deceived there. Now, when we analyze this, we say - the color entered the eye, the consciousness of the eye arose, then disappeared, the consciousness of the mind arose. But in reality this is all happening at great speed. Like a movie: although it actually consists of individual frames, they change at such a high speed that we do not perceive them as changing static images - we perceive them as some kind of objects moving on the screen. Therefore, our task is first of all to understand reality in one place as the Buddha explains it. 
                  </font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now our six senses work very quickly and we live in some kind of constant world. If we need to see reality, then we must catch at least one deception. Just like when we collect rice from a rice field: we take a sickle, collect a bunch of rice with our hand and cut it off with the sickle.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we heard the sound of construction and began to think about some person, and we can think backwards about where this person came from. And we can see: I heard something, the mind perceived it, I began to think about it. I remembered the person, and now I think about the person. We grasp these thoughts like a bunch of rice. And then we go in reverse order to cut them off: the person arose in my mind (in the ayatana of the mind), and in the real event there were other senses (other ayatanas, other spheres of perception). There was some sound, after this hearing the mind begins to think about some person. We catch our mind and begin to see how ill will came into being, how attachment came into being, how greed came into being. Where did they come from? In place of the sound that the mind perceived as a person, this is deception. Everything that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body perceives is all neutral. Thirst and aversion appear only in the mind. If we understand that it is deception, we let it go. ItТs as if we mistook a mirage for water: as soon as we understand that it is a mirage, we immediately let go, because we understand that there was no water there. Therefore, we can say that we cut off these thoughts of ours that arose due to ignorance. The sickle to cut off this ignorance is the Buddha's Teaching and our wisdom, only through this can we be freed.</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in fact, during meditation there is not much we need to do: practice keeping the mind on the object of awareness. We only need a pure mind. When the mind becomes calm, we will be able to catch such erroneous moments and understand reality, and then we will again practice mindfulness. This is how we practice </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">samatha-vipassana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try to recognize your senses, your spheres of perception as they are. Try to see impermanence: impermanence means when there are reasons, sense organs arise, when there are no reasons, sense organs disappear. Good luck with your practice!</font></font></font></div>
