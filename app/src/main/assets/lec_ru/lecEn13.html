                  <font size="5" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#996633"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today</font></font></font></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I want to explain to you what is not the development of the mind, meditation, and what are the pitfalls on this path. The Pali word</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> bhavana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is usually translated as "meditation", or we can say that</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> bhavana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is the development of the mind. There are many false views in the world, false understandings about what meditation is and what is the development of meditation.</font></font></font> 
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some say that during meditation they saw a clear light. Someone may say, "During meditation I saw Buddha." Or someone may say that they saw God or deities. Some claim that they see other worlds, their past and future births, different levels of the mind. Others say that their third eye or chakras open. But these are all mind games.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's figure out what mind games are and what the mind is, how it works. Objects of the mind appear in the mind, which can be thoughts. How do thoughts appear? Usually they appear as our inner voice, but this is not always the case. For example, you can remember your favorite song and then you will hear not your voice, but the voice of the artist. Or you can hear the voice of some relative. Also, sometimes people hear as if Buddha is talking to them, or God, but all this is also thoughts. Thoughts can also appear in the form of sounds, pictures. For example, if I sit and meditate, a school can appear in my mind. I can see it, the faces of my teachers, friends, the school yard and so on - these are also all thoughts. I can remember the taste of some food, a smell, touches: all these are also objects of the mind.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I remember my school or childhood, these are some real, understandable pictures. We understand that these are thoughts, that these are objects of the mind. But, let's say, I see some creatures unknown to me, something I've never seen before. For example, people living at the bottom of the ocean. What do you think this is? These are fantasies, games of the mind. These are also, in fact, just thoughts.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we meditate, our mind develops: calmness, concentration, attentiveness develop. The mind begins to work more actively, and we can begin to see some things that we have never seen, for example, some colors, smells, light. Something that we have never seen before in the world. But what is this? These are also objects of the mind. This is not reality - this is a game of the mind. This is 
                     </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sankhara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , formations of the mind.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During meditation, the mind can get bored. The mind needs food all the time, and when we just sit and observe the object of awareness, there is little food for the mind, so the mind starts looking for something, inventing something, fantasizing. And we must know in advance that these are games of the mind, because otherwise we may get some thoughts about it, we may start believing in it, getting attached. We may get lost there.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember my very first retreat. I was still a lay person then. There were five of us lay men and many women. And I remember that one of the men always meditated outside. There was almost always bright sun outside and he was sitting facing it. And after some time, about five days, he came up to me and said, "You know, I see light during meditation, so round, moving."</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had read a lot of books before the retreat, so I knew a little about meditation, and I immediately told him: you need to go to the teacher and tell him about it. But this man replied that he was embarrassed to go to the teacher and tell him about it, because he was embarrassed that the teacher would then find out what a high level he had reached. He thought that he had reached some high level! That it would be immodest to reveal this to other people - as if it would be an expression of his pride. He thought that this was an expression of his modesty, but in fact everything was exactly the opposite. In the teaching, this is called </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adhimana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is pride, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adhimana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is enormous pride, overestimation of oneself. It is very difficult for a person to see this in himself, because he thinks that he does not have it. This person should have simply gone and revealed his secret experience to the teacher. The teacher would have corrected him and explained everything to him: that this is just light, you need to let it go and move on.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the retreat ended and this man continued to practice on his own at home. I remember that for uposatha we came to the monastery and took 8 vows. This man also came to the monastery and told me that he continues to meditate on this light, and now even when he rides a bicycle with open eyes, he sees this light in front of him. Do you know what happened next? He built himself a small temple, began to call people, tell their fortunes and believe that he has some supernatural powers.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look how the mind plays with a person. When this person told others all this, people believed him, because he believed it himself: he was talking about his experience! But these are all mind games. Our road is long, and this person went the wrong way and got lost. He remained at the very beginning of the path, trapped in false views.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My teacher told me that one monk was meditating, and at some point he began to have visions of thousands of monks coming to bow to him. An endless line of people coming to bow to him. These visions did not give him peace. Why do you think he had such visions? He wanted it! This is his mind, he wants it. These are also mind games. Some picture arose in the mind and then further streams of thought began to develop. These streams of thought were not words, but pictures, images.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some people see Buddha in meditation, and after that they feel great joy. But in reality it is not Buddha, it is their mind. Any other image can also arise, for example, a demon. What will happen after that? You can be afraid of this demon. But what did you actually see? You saw your mind, your thoughts, but you were afraid of some external object that does not exist. There is even such a widespread opinion in the world that meditating is dangerous and it is better not to do it. But this opinion arose because people simply meditated on their own, thinking that only solitude was needed, that you can just sit and observe, and from this become Buddha or get enlightenment.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our mind can deceive us in ways that we never see ourselves, so we definitely need the Teaching and some good friend or teacher to show us the right path so that we don’t get lost and fall into a trap.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have one distant relative who often came to visit us. When I, already a monk, returned from studying in Russia, he came to me and said that he knew a certain mantra, and no one knew what language it was in. Since I knew several languages &#8203;&#8203;by that time, he came to me with a request to help him determine what language this mantra was in. He recited it to me, and it was just a jumble of some made-up words, words in Pali, Sanskrit, Sinhalese, Tamil. It was just some kind of nonsense! But he did not believe me, because he was sure that it was a mantra. And people believed him. He went around, removed some witchcraft, did something else, and people paid him for it. It became his job! But first of all, he himself was deceived. He does not think that he is deceiving others, he does not understand his own delusions. And at some point this mind game became beneficial to him.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we meditate, we want to see the world as it is. Our goal is to see reality. So we are constantly observing some real things. For example, when we practice anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), we observe tactile sensations: maybe it is a point under the nose, maybe it is a sensation in the nostrils, or a sensation in the upper lip. But some people say that they feel the air they inhale moving a few meters or even kilometers away. If a person begins to observe this, then he will not be observing reality, but some kind of mental deception, his fantasy. Reality is simple. Just sensations in the nostrils, sensations in the body - what is right now, what is available to our direct experience.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During my very first retreat, at one point, while meditating while walking, I began to feel a great lightness, as if I was not touching the ground at all. There was such lightness, such joy! What do you think it was? It was </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">piti</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - rapture, joy, and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">passaddhi</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - lightness. When such joy arises in the mind, it immediately affects the whole body and lightness appears in the body. This is something that a person can really feel, it is not a deception, not a fantasy. Was this a development of meditation?</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Teaching explains the qualities that arise during meditation that can become defilements of the mind: </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">vipassana upakilesa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , 10 types of defilements or distortions of the mind that can arise during the development of insight meditation (vipassana).</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These qualities themselves are not defilements, but they can become qualities that support the defilements of the mind - this is the meaning of the word </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upakilesa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The danger is that craving, attachment can develop to these states and qualities, and then they become defilements of the mind. And what's more, a person can perceive this as the end of the practice. Then these qualities become </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upakilesa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of these qualities is the appearance of light, </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">obhasa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . When a person meditates and a high level </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">of samadhi</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                    (concentration, calmness, one-pointedness) develops in the mind, then light appears that is not associated with physical phenomena.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two more qualities are </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">piti</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (rapture, joy) and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">passaddhi</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (lightness). In ordinary life, a person never feels such joy and lightness. When I began to feel them, it was the 10th day of the retreat, the very last day. I remember how the retreat ended, and we went to visit my sick friend. I was walking along the road and thought that now I will lose all this. And so it happened. And after that, I began to wait for the next retreat to feel it again.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such joy, such delight, such ease - it is impossible to get them in worldly life, it is something immaterial. And when I got to the next retreat, I sat and thought that I already know how to get there, how to achieve this - it's just a matter of a little. I sat and tried to repeat this experience, but it did not appear again. I tried different methods: everything to find again what I had lost. For many years I suffered so much, searching, thinking that before I meditated well, but now I can’t do anything anymore.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fact that joy and lightness can appear during meditation is normal in itself, but I did not see my greed then. If you do not know about it in advance, then you will never guess that you cannot love these states, you cannot become attached to them, that you have to let them go and move on.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adhimokkha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , when a person develops a huge </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">saddha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (faith, confidence, trust). This can also cause a person to think that he has reached the end, that this is the end of his practice, and then this becomes an obstacle.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next quality is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">paggaha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , diligence, striving. When a person tries all the time. Even this quality can become a support for impurities. And it can lead to a lot of tension.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then comes </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sukha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , happiness. A person can feel pleasant bodily sensations.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among these qualities there is also </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nyan</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , knowledge. When a person has some knowledge of vipassana, for example, he can analyze nama-rupa, or he knows about the five aggregates, about the six ayatanas, about the 18 dhatus. He first received this knowledge, and then developed it during insight meditation. But a person can perceive this knowledge as "I", as his achievements, and not see </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">anatta</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> there - selflessness.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then there is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upekkha</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : equanimity, serenity. This is one of the brahmaviharas, what we should strive for, what we should develop, but even this quality can become </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upakilesa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then 
                     </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upatthana</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , mindfulness, awareness, presence. It happens that a person develops such a high level of presence that he wakes up consciously, does everything consciously, falls asleep consciously. But even with such a level of presence, it happens that a person does not see that he begins to consider himself as his self, and how pride arises in him because of this. This is precisely what a person may not see, and then presence becomes </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upakilesa</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                    - a quality that supports defilements.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next such quality is nikanti: a subtle thirst for practice, for vipassana.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We must understand that these qualities do not manifest at the initial level of practice. But it is important for us to understand that even such good qualities can become </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">upakilesas</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . We need to be aware and perceive our mind, our qualities, and even our wisdom not as “I”, but as a result of something. Perceive everything impersonally. We need to let go of all this and move on.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you meditate, some pictures, images, some strange experiences will definitely arise in your mind. The mind becomes stronger, brighter, more powerful, and therefore some thoughts, images can be perceived differently, more clearly and vividly than usual. Let them go. Don’t be afraid, there is nothing scary there. These thoughts will not do anything to you. All these thoughts are temporary, they came for a while and will also go away. Whatever good experiences you have, whatever joy you develop, immediately understand: this is temporary, it will all go away. Don’t get attached to this. If you are attached to this, then you are trapped. Or if you begin to see some images, light, sounds, anything, think immediately: I am not seeing the external world, I am seeing my mind, these are the objects of the mind.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the development of the mind then? If a person sees that he has fewer attachments, less greed, less ill will in life - this will be the development of the mind. If you become more calm, aware, patient - this will be the development of the mind. Also, the development of the mind is wisdom.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do we know what wisdom is? We begin to understand what to do and how to think. Wisdom will come with experience. We will understand how not to think, how anger, disgust, greed develop from these streams of thoughts. Buddha says that if a person knows his mind filled with anger as a mind filled with anger, then this is wisdom. Or if a person, being in ignorance, knows that he is in ignorance, then this is wisdom. If a person with a mind filled with greed knows his mind as a mind filled with greed, then this is wisdom.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It often happens that people are tormented by regrets about some past actions, that they did something wrong. Regret is actually an unwholesome quality, and it must be let go. But why can't people let it go? They think that it is a good quality, that they should have it, that they need it. They begin to see their "I" in it. You need to develop wisdom, see this clinging, see that there is suffering there too, that it is also impersonal. And let it go.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now just study your mind, your thinking. Start seeing greed, anger, disgust, compassion, kindness in it. Start seeing it. If you see it in yourself, that is wisdom. It is easy to see it in others, but it is very difficult to see it in yourself. If you see your mind, then wisdom will develop in you.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Right efforts also develop: we try to get rid of mental impurities. Good qualities of the mind develop: kindness, compassion, faith, clarity of mind, doubts go away. There are many such good qualities.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By focusing on this, you can understand whether you are going in the right direction. And if you want to seriously engage in meditation, you must definitely find yourself a teacher and you must trust him. Look how many people fall into the traps of the mind because they do not tell their teachers about their experiences.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wish you success in your practice, may this knowledge help you avoid all the pitfalls and achieve liberation!</font></font><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font></div>
