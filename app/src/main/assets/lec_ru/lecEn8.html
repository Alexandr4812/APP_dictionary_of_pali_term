                    This means that all the Buddha's Teaching is intended for those who can think correctly, who can direct their mind. If we simply pray to Buddha, we will not need the Teaching, praying to Buddha is useless. Blind faith </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(amulika saddha)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">  
                    is also not encouraged in the Buddha's Teaching, one must believe correctly: one needs well-founded faith </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(akaravant saddha)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and it appears only when a person thinks correctly.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    Let's see what right thinking (wise thinking) is. If we look at how humans differ from animals, first of all it will be the ability to think, use logic, form understanding, remember our experiences and think about them. But even though we know how to think, we do not know how to think correctly.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to think correctly? It is to think in such a way that suffering does not arise. If while we are thinking we experience some stress, dissatisfaction, disgust, anger, hatred, greed - these are signs that we are thinking incorrectly. If we consider all our suffering - almost all of it arises in the mind, through thinking.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suffering can be divided into several types. There is physical pain: from sitting in one position for a long time, from heat or cold, from illnesses, and so on. In the Buddha's Teaching, this suffering is not considered a type of suffering that we need to get rid of, it is already an inevitable result of the fact that we have a body. As long as we have a body, we cannot get rid of this type of suffering. But it is considered that physical suffering is an insignificant amount compared to our mental suffering. And it is precisely with this that we work. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    We usually do not notice our mental suffering, but in fact it greatly affects our body, our entire well-being. We begin to feel it in the body: when our mood worsens, we feel our body differently, it becomes heavy. Even the slightest unpleasant sensations are perceived very acutely, we cannot tolerate them, even more disgust appears in the mind, we want it not to be, and this causes anger. So when suffering arises in the mind, it affects the body, bodily unpleasant sensations develop and increase, so some initial unpleasant sensation in the body is not the same as what we will feel in the end. What we will feel is already the influence of our mind on the body.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can say that we create almost all of our suffering ourselves at every moment of time. Even now we create it, although we may not see it. How does this suffering arise? It arises through our thinking. When we think some thoughts, it seems to us that these are just thoughts and it is not important, but they all contain some sensations, emotions, and all this affects the mind. When there is a stream of thoughts in the mind, some state gradually appears, and we begin to see the whole world through this state of mind.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever our state of mind is, such will be our world, therefore, if we think incorrectly, we cannot change anything: our suffering is entirely dependent on the external world. We do not control our mind, we are entirely dependent on the world: we think as the world dictates to us. Therefore, it is very important to be able to think correctly. Only in this way can we liberate ourselves, only in this way can we find happiness and peace, therefore, Buddha says that his Teaching will be useful to those who have </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's now see how we can apply all this in practice, how we can think correctly. We were just meditating, and we could hear children shouting and playing in the street. If the mind is distracted by this, then after the sounds of the game from the street, some thoughts, memories arise. Perhaps about your own childhood, maybe about other children, maybe about something else. So the mind wanders in the past, until we realize at some point that we are not meditating. After that, thoughts immediately arise: "Because the children are noisy, I cannot meditate." What happens after that, when we think like that? The children immediately become guilty of the fact that I do not meditate: my mind wanders, I am distracted, the children are to blame.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's now analyze what happened to the mind. These were wrong thoughts, but how can we think wisely? For meditation, we just need to return to the object of awareness, but for this we need to somehow direct our mind. In order to get used to directing our mind, we sometimes need some wise thoughts, because when we understand that we have not meditated for the last 5 minutes, then the next thoughts will definitely be some kind of experiences, regret will appear. And this regret either goes outward, to the outside world, and is directed at children as some kind of disgust, or goes inward and is directed at oneself. "I can't meditate, I have lost awareness again, I don't know how to meditate, why am I so unconscious" - some such thoughts appear, and then I am to blame. Both will be 
                     </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ayoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order for this regret not to be directed either at the external world or at ourselves, and so that we do not suffer from it, we definitely need some wise reflections. For example, if we think that we simply did not have enough awareness at that moment, so some thoughts simply arose, and now I can return to the object of awareness, then even though these will also be thoughts, this will be wise reflection.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the Buddha's teaching, practice is not only meditation while sitting. Practice is everywhere for us. We can practice at home, on the street, and at work. If we have anger and hatred in our mind, then we must practice kindness and compassion. How can we do this? We can think about the harm that anger brings us, how it makes us feel bad first of all. The thoughts that appear in our mind are our kamma. And the ill will that appears in our mind is our unwholesome kamma, it will bring unwholesome results to us, not to someone else. It will harm us in this life and in the next.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have to somehow direct our thought streams in a different direction. If we are angry at some person we know who does something we don’t like, we can remember some of his good qualities, his good deeds, and with this help let go of our anger. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    The Teaching describes many different ways how we can develop our kindness, how we can fight against unwholesome states of mind. In the Vitakkasanthana Sutta (MN 20) five ways are explained, all of this will be </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    1. Switching to wholesome thoughts. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    2. Reflecting on the danger of unwholesome thoughts. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    3. Forgetting unwholesome thoughts (which means stopping paying attention to them). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    4. Relaxing unwholesome thoughts. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    5. Suppressing unwholesome thoughts.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
                    If there are some unpleasant sensations that we cannot influence, then we can simply stop thinking about it, stop winding ourselves up and simply observe these sensations. When we really observe our sensations, we can see that in fact it is not so bad. We can observe and practice right patience. We can think: "How much more in life will I have to endure such unpleasant moments, so I will practice, I will not torture myself - I will simply observe the unpleasant sensations that arise in the body." Such thoughts are also </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . They make us feel better, they develop wisdom, patience, diligence - these are right thoughts.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we see unpleasant sensations, we can observe them, we can tolerate them correctly and learn to practice serenity, imperturbability </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(upekkha)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the mind. So that when an unpleasant sensation appears in the body, the mind does not tense up, so that disgust does not appear in the mind. You can think like this, and these thoughts will support awareness, and this will also be </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we start thinking about renunciation, about goodwill, about compassion – these will be correct thoughts. Laypeople can also practice renunciation, for example, fight envy. If we see some good things (a car, a house, something else) in someone’s possession, and the mind starts wanting it, then we can control this level. After all, if I think like this, then greed will develop in the mind, and I myself will suffer from this, and I actually don’t need all these things. What I have is actually enough for me: I have everything to be happy. If a person starts thinking like this, then renunciation appears in his mind. And a person needs this, without this he will definitely suffer.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or kindness – you can practice it everywhere. You can appreciate the good qualities of people. Think about the kindness of the world, the world is not as bad as we think: there are many good people, kind people. We can think about them, see them, see their actions, notice them, appreciate them. Then we begin to change ourselves, we begin to want to practice kindness ourselves.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And compassion: when we see angry people, greedy people, wrong people – don’t hate them. They lack wisdom – think about it. They suffer in this life, they cannot be happy, they have no peace in their minds. We can say that they are ill: ill with mental obscurations, so we can feel sorry for them. We can wish: may they find the right path, may they meet good people, may they correct their mistakes, may there be more good people in the world. Somehow direct your mind in the right direction. If we don’t do this – we ourselves will become like that, we ourselves will become the same people whom we hate, whom we don’t want to see and hear. When we begin to hate them, we ourselves are approaching the point of becoming like that. If you don’t want to be like them, then you have to think differently, and this is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To practice </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara,</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> you definitely need awareness, vigilance, you need to watch yourself and your mind. You need to see your anger as anger, your pride as pride, greed as greed, envy as jealousy, only then can we change our mind.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we start thinking how great we are, or how bad we are, why did I make mistakes again – this is where pride develops. These are just different types of pride – comparing yourself to others. In order not to think like this, we must have awareness. Do you see how wise a person must be in order not to suffer? If we lack wisdom – we begin to suffer, and we suffer wherever we are. It is very important to learn to think correctly, this skill cannot be compared with any other skills.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will come a day for all of us when we have to leave everything and go. We may have to lie in a hospital and endure all sorts of medical procedures: injections, IVs, medications. That day will come, we must be prepared. If we live as long as everyone wishes us to, then there may come a day when we will not be able to take the glass of water next to us. When we will not even be able to say that we want to drink. In order not to suffer at that moment, a person must be wise enough to be able to let go of his body, not to accept it as "I". But if a person begins to think: "Who have I become, how did I get to this point", then his next life will also be bad.</font></font></font></div>
                  <div class="a"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have our whole life to learn </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">yoniso manasikara</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , to develop wisdom, so I wish for you that you do not waste time, that you think correctly, that these merits will help you to be free from all suffering, that you will attain nibbana. </font></font><br>
