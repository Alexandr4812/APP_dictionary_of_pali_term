<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="ayvchubn24p4e"></a></span><span class="tm22">The Story of Satagiri and Hemavata<br /></span><span
 class="tm23">and the Hemavata Sutta</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The Buddha delivered the Wheel of Dhamma discourse shortly before sunset on the full moon day of the month of July (&#256;s&#257;&#7735;ha) in 528 BCE. At midnight
he delivered the Hemavata Sutta, sometimes called the S&#257;t&#257;giri Sutta (Snp 1.9).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The detailed circumstances of the teaching of this sutta were as follows:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&nbsp;<br />In the Good Kappa, when the human lifespan reached 20,000 years, Buddha Kassapa appeared and attained Parinibbana after living 16,000 years, which was
four-fifths of the lifespan of that time. The cremation of his remains was performed with great reverence. The Buddha&#39;s bodily relics did not fall apart but remained as one solid golden mass. This was the natural law (dhammat&#257;)
for all Buddhas who live during the period when human lifespans reach such a long time.<br /><br />As for short-lived Buddhas, they attain Parinibbana before many people have had the chance to see them. Therefore, out of compassion,
wishing, &quot;May many people living in different towns and villages gain merit by honoring the relics even after I attain Parinibbana,&quot; they resolve, &quot;May my relics fall apart during cremation.&quot; Because of
this, the relics of short-lived Buddhas, like the relics of our Buddha, fell apart into pieces that could then be used as relics.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The people built a large stupa one league high and the same in circumference, and placed in it the only relic of the Buddha Kassapa. Each side in one direction was
one mile long, and on each side there was a large entrance gate, so that the distance between the gates was one mile.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">King Kiki of Varanasi donated one gate; his son, Prince Pathavindhara, donated another; the officials, headed by an army general, donated a third; and the public,
headed by a wealthy official, donated the last. The bricks used to build the great stupa were made of precious metals and gems. A special mixture of realgar and special oil was used as cement in the construction of the stupa.
After the great stupa was built, two friends from noble families renounced the worldly life and took monastic ordination in the presence of senior disciples who had followed the Buddha during his lifetime.<br /><br /></span><em><span
 class="tm27">It is especially noteworthy that in the Teaching (Sasana) of the long-lived Buddhas, only such senior disciples were competent to ordain monks and also to give them instructions. Those who became disciples only
after the Buddha&#39;s Parinibbana were not qualified to perform such tasks.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm27">This is different from the situation with short-lived Buddhas, like our Buddha Gotama, where the lineage continues after Parinibbana through fully ordained monks.
In the case of Buddha Kassapa, who was a long-lived Buddha, only those who personally met him or his direct disciples during his lifetime could perform ordinations.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Then these two monk friends from noble families asked the senior disciples: &quot;Venerable sirs, what are the tasks of monks that must be accomplished in the Buddha&#39;s
Teaching?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">To this the senior disciples answered them:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Monks, there are two duties for monks in the Buddha&#39;s Teaching:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">1) Practice of insight meditation (v&#257;sa-dhura)</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">2) Study or teaching of scriptures (pariyatti-dhura)</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Of these two, the monk is from a noble family:</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">1. Spends five years with his mentors, taking care of their needs</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">2. Studies and masters the Monastic Rules (P&#257;timokkha)</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">3. Studies two or three sections (bh&#257;&#7751;av&#257;ra) of the suttas</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">4. Undergoes proper training in insight meditation (vipassan&#257;)</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">5. Cuts off attachment to his fellow monks and lay followers.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">6. After this, having retired to a large forest, far from people, he practices meditation for the realization of Awakening.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">This is the monastic duty of practicing insight meditation (v&#257;sa-dhura).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Or he must, according to his abilities:</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">1. To learn and become skilled in one collection (nik&#257;ya) of baskets (pi&#7789;aka)</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">2. Or in two, three, four or five collections of baskets</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">3. To strive to develop correct and pure teaching (pariyatti-s&#257;sana) both in letter and in spirit.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">It is the duty of a monk to study or teach (pariyatti-dhura).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Having said, &quot;Of the two duties that monks should perform, the practice of insight meditation (v&#257;sa-dhura) is the highest and more meritorious,&quot; the
two monk-friends nevertheless thought, &quot;We are still young. We should perform the practice of insight meditation only when we become older. Before we become old, we will practice to fulfill and complete the duty of studying
and teaching the scriptures (pariyatti-dhura).&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Being naturally intelligent, they:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">In a short time, we mastered all three baskets (pi&#7789;aka),</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Became very skilled in making decisions on Vinaya matters,</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Due to their knowledge of the scriptures, the two monk friends became very famous,</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">They always had a large entourage and many gifts and offerings,</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Each of them had 500 monk followers,</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The elders continued to give instructions (ov&#257;da) to the four assemblies of people who came to them.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">As a result, the Teaching flourished and shone, as if the Buddha had appeared again.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="a4c6urwra4zqd"></a>Dhamma and non-Dhamma</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">At that time, in a monastery near a village, there lived two monks: one who taught the Dhamma and the other who taught the opposite Dhamma (adhamma-v&#257;d&#299;).
Of the two, the monk who taught the opposite Dhamma was rude and harsh in speech. Once, when the monk who taught the Dhamma clearly learned of the other monk&#8217;s violation of a certain disciplinary rule, he rebuked the
latter thus: &#8220;Friend, your behavior is unworthy of the Dhamma!&#8221; To this, the monk who taught the opposite Dhamma, in order to interrupt the original course of conversation, retorted, saying: &#8220;Friend, what
do you see in me? What do you hear about me? Do not make hasty accusations!&#8221; The monk who taught the Dhamma replied: &#8220;Friend, the noble elders who are the guardians of the Vinaya know better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">A monk who taught the opposite Dhamma thought, &quot;If the elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, decide this matter according to the Vinaya, I will definitely not have
any support for the Teaching,&quot; and he immediately went to the two elders, the keepers of the Vinaya. He approached them with certain offerings as gifts in order to deceive them and win them over to his side. He bowed
respectfully and presented what he had brought to them and tried to obtain their guidance. He pretended to have due respect for them and to wish to be near them for service.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Once a monk who taught contrary to the Dhamma came to the assembly place of the elders, the guardians of the Vinaya, and after paying respects he continued to stand
stubbornly, even when the elders asked him to leave. The elders asked him, &quot;Friend, do you have anything special to tell us?&quot; and he replied, &quot;Yes, venerable sirs, I do. I have had a dispute with another monk
about breaking the precept. If he were to come to you and report this matter, please do not decide according to what is considered appropriate.&quot; When the elders replied, &quot;In a matter that has been presented to the
Sangha, it is wrong and inappropriate not to decide according to what is considered correct,&quot; he begged them, saying, &quot;Venerable sirs, if such a decision is made, I will have no support in the Doctrine. Let this
offence remain mine. I will bear its consequences in Samsara. Just do not decide this matter, please!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Being persistent and persistent, he finally got his way, the guardians of the Vinaya relented and said, &quot;Okay, monk!&quot; Having received the consent of the
elders, the monk who taught the opposite Dhamma returned to the village monastery; and thinking, &quot;I have done everything I wanted to do with the elders, the guardians of the Vinaya,&quot; he became even more overbearing,
contemptuous, rude and unyielding in his treatment of the monk who taught the Dhamma.<br /><br />The monk who taught the Dhamma, thinking, &quot;This monk who teaches the opposite Dhamma is truly not afraid of anything!&quot;
immediately left the monastery and went to the monks who were followers of the elders, the guardians of the Vinaya, and addressed them:<br /><br />&quot;Brothers, should not a case coming to the Sangha be decided according
to the Vinaya? Or, without allowing the case to come to the Sangha, should not the accusing monk and the accused monk admit their own mistakes and settle their dispute peacefully? But now these elders, the guardians of the
Vinaya, are neither deciding the case themselves, nor are they allowing us to settle it peacefully through compromise. What does this mean?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Hearing the words of the monk who taught the Dhamma and thinking, &#8220;The elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, must already know something wrong,&#8221; the thousand
monks who were disciples of the elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, made no reply and remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The monk who taught the opposite of the Dhamma later took advantage of this and one day said in a suppressive tone:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Friend, you said earlier that the elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, would know. Well, now you had better report this matter to them.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&nbsp;Then he left, saying rudely:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;From now on you are completely destroyed! Do not return to the village monastery where we live!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">After this, the monk who taught the Dhamma went to the elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, and loudly lamented:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Venerable sirs, thinking, &#39;that this monk who teaches something contrary to the Dhamma is taking care of our needs and pleasing us,&#39; you have no respect
for the Buddha&#39;s Teaching, but only respect for an individual; you do not protect the Teaching, but only protect a shameless immoral person. Sirs, from today on you should not decide any matters pertaining to the Vinaya.&quot;
Then he left the elders and lamented:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;The Teaching (S&#257;sana) of Buddha Kassapa has indeed been defiled!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">After this, the two elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, were deeply moved and felt remorse (kukkucca), saying:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;By showing respect and giving protection only to this shameless immoral person, we have thrown the solid jewel of the Teaching (S&#257;sana) into the abyss
of deep waters.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Wounded and with a depressed mind full of regret (kukkucca), they were not reborn in the higher realms after their death.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Of the two elders, one was reborn as a Yaksha named Hemavata on Mount Hemavata in Himavanta, and the other was also reborn as a Yaksha named Satagiri on Mount Sata
in the Middle Country (Majjhima-desa). The thousand monks who followed these two elders were also not reborn in the higher heavenly abodes. Because they supported the elders, they were reborn as followers, 500 each of the
two Yakshas. However, those who supported the four necessities of the elders, the keepers of the Vinaya, were reborn in the higher planes of existence of the Devas.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Both Hemavata and Satagiri were Yakshas of great power and fame and were included in the list of 28 generals of the Devas. It was the custom of the Devas to hold
meetings to decide on legal cases eight times a month in a pavilion called Nagavati, on the flat surface of a realgar rock in the Himavanta forests. These two Yakshas used to participate in the meetings.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Satagiri and Hemavata, seeing each other at the said meetings of the Devas and remembering their past lives in the human world, asked each other about the place of
their present existence:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Friend, in what place were you reborn? And you, friend, what is your place of rebirth?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">And they were struck with great melancholy, telling of their fate:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Friend, we have truly been irreparably destroyed! Even though we practiced the Dhamma for the entire period of 20,000 years during the Teaching of Buddha Kassapa
in the past, we were reborn as Yakshas because of our shameless, immoral friend. However, some of our followers who uphold our four necessities were reborn in the higher realms of sensual pleasures.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="a1nxinswxqsgf"></a></span><span class="tm23">Mutual Promises</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">After this, Satagiri said to Hemavata:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;My friend Hemavata, it is said that Himavanta, where you live, is a wonderful and unusual place. Therefore, if you see or hear anything strange and unusual,
please come and inform me.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Hemavata also said to Satagiri:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;My friend Satagiri, the Middle Country where you live is a region where noble people appear and live, and it is said to be a wonderful and unusual country.
If you see or hear anything strange and unusual, please come and tell me.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Thus the two friends, Satagiri and Hemavata, made a mutual promise to each other and continued to live without being able to get rid of their existence as yakshas;
during this time even one immeasurable period passed between the appearance of one Buddha and the other (Buddhantara-kappa). During this period the great earth also increased by one league&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote1"><span class="tm13">1</span></a><a id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm26">and three miles.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">At that time, our Bodhisatta practiced and developed the ten perfections (p&#257;ram&#299;) for the entire period of four immeasurable periods and 100,000 kalpas,
from the time he received the definite prophecy from the Buddha D&#299;pa&#7749;kara that he would become a Buddha until the time of his life as King Vessantara. He then took rebirth in the Tushita realm and lived there the
full span of a Deva&#39;s life. At the request of the Devas who had come from all the 10,000 worlds, after conducting the five great examinations, he gave them his consent to become a Buddha. He then accepted conception in
the womb of Queen Maha Maya in this human world, causing the 10,000 worlds to tremble while the 32 great signs were manifested.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">These two friends, Satagiri and Hemavata, knew about the appearance of 32 great signs at the time of the Bodhisatta&#39;s conception, but it so happened that they
did not pay attention to them. They did not reflect, &quot;These great signs appear because the Bodhisatta was conceived.&quot; The 32 great signs also appeared clearly at the Bodhisatta&#39;s birth, at his renunciation of
the world, and when he became a Buddha. Although they knew about the appearance of these great signs, they did not reflect or realize, &quot;These great signs appear because of these events.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">When the Buddha called the Five Monks and taught the Discourse on the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhamma-chakka), which has three phases and twelve aspects, there was a distinctly
strong earthquake, and also the wonderful and unusual 32 great signs appeared. This was first noticed by Satagiri of the two Yakshas, and learning that the Buddha was then teaching the Discourse on the Wheel of Dhamma, the
root cause of signs, he went to the Buddha along with his retinue of 500 Yakshas and listened to the teaching of the Wheel of Dhamma. But he could not attain any significant path and fruit.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The reason was that Satagiri, while listening to the discourse of the Wheel of Dhamma, remembered his friend Hemavata and looked around the assembly, thinking:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;Did my friend Hemavata come to this Dhamma meeting? Or not?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Not finding Hemavata, his mind became scattered:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;How could my friend Hemavata be so late! He may not have time to listen to the Buddha&#39;s teaching on the Wheel of Dhamma, which is so wonderful and magnificent
both in letter and in spirit!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">It is for this reason that he was unable to realize any important path and fruit.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The sun was already setting, but the Buddha continued preaching the Wheel of Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Then, after thinking:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;I will go and bring my friend Hemavata to hear the Wheel of Dhamma preaching.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Satagiri created vehicles and travelled through the air in the direction where Hemavata and his retinue of 500 yakshas were.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">The two yakshas met each other in the sky above the city of Rajagaha. When Satagiri asked the reason for his visit, Hemavata said:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;My friend Satagiri, ever since I became a yaksha in the Himavanta forests, this great mountain Hemavata has never looked so delightful, with trees blooming
out of season. Therefore, I have come to visit you, intending to enjoy these wonderful flowers of the Himavanta forests with you.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">When Satagiri asked Hemavata:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;My friend Hemavata, do you know why these flowers bloom out of season and in such a wonderful way?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">He replied:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;I don&#39;t know, my friend Satagiri.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Then Satagiri said to Hemavata:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">&quot;My friend Hemavata, this wonderful and extraordinary phenomenon has not only happened in this Himavanta. In fact, the same thing has happened everywhere in
the 10,000 world system. My friend Hemavata, the Buddha has appeared in the three worlds of humans, devas and brahmas. The Buddha is now teaching the Wheel of Dhamma in a park called Isipatana near the city of Varanasi. Because
the Buddha is teaching the Wheel of Dhamma, 32 wonderful and extraordinary great signs have clearly manifested throughout the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="acakt75tzawyh"></a></span><span class="tm23">How Kali Became the First Stream-Entering Lay Woman</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">At that time, like a divine maiden enjoying divine luxury, a woman named Kali, who was pregnant and resided in the city of Rajagaha, where she had returned to give
birth to a child in her parents&#39; house, went up to the upper terrace of her parents&#39; mansion and, opening the window decorated with lions, stood and breathed the fresh air to relieve the pains of her approaching birth.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm27">Kali was originally from the city of Rajagaha. On reaching adulthood, she was married at Kuraraghara in Avanti. When the time came for her delivery, she returned
to her parents&#39; house. As she climbed up to the terrace of the mansion and tried to ease her pain from the approaching birth with some fresh air, she heard two yakshas speaking about the virtues of the Buddha.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Having heard the whole conversation between the two Yakshas about the virtues of the Buddha, Kali listened attentively to them and thought:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;Truly, Buddhas are endowed with such amazing and extraordinary qualities!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">At this thought she became filled with joy and rapture. Standing in that very place in a state of joy and having removed the hindrances through that joy, she attained
insight knowledge and thereby attained the fruit of stream entry (Sot&#257;patti).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Kali, being the first stream-enterer (Sot&#257;panna) and noble disciple (ariya-s&#257;vika) among women, was, one might say, the eldest sister of the entire female
race. That same night she gave birth to a son, who later became the venerable Sona Kutikanna.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After staying at her parents&#39; house for as long as she wanted, she returned to her home in Kuraraghara.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus, without even meeting or seeing the Buddha, but simply hearing about him and fixing her mind on the great qualities of the Buddha, she gained absolute faith
in the Buddha&#39;s qualities and became established in the fruit of stream entry (Sot&#257;patti-phala), just as one effortlessly accepts food that has already been prepared and served. That is why later, when the Buddha,
sitting among the Sangha, held a meeting to confer titles on outstanding lay women, he declared, &quot;Dear monks, Kali of Kuraraghara is the most noble and excellent of all lay women (up&#257;sik&#257;) who have gained absolute
faith in the Three Jewels simply by hearing!&quot; and appointed her first among those who have gained faith by hearing (anussava-pas&#257;da).</span></p>

<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Ajja pannaraso uposatho, dibb&#257; ratti upa&#7789;&#7789;hit&#257;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Hemavata, today is indeed the full moon day of Uposatha on the fifteenth lunar day! Today is a very pleasant night when the whole of Jambudipa
appears as if splendidly adorned with the bodily light of the Devas and Brahmas who have come from 10,000 worlds to hear the discourse, for this is the day when the Buddha teaches the Dhamma-cakka Sutta, all illuminated by
the radiance of their robes and heavenly abodes, by the light of the moon, stars and lunar constellations, and by the bodily light of the Visuddha Deva and the Buddha himself. My friend Hemavata, do not be troubled by doubt
whether this is the Buddha or not. Come! Let us go right now and pay homage to the Buddha Gotama, who is endowed with undiminished qualities, possesses such special epithets as Buddha, Blessed One and others, and who is the
teacher of men, Devas and Brahmas.&quot;<br /><br /></span></em><span class="tm13">Hearing the words of Satagiri, Hemavata thought and reasoned thus:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;This Satagiri boldly asserts that the person he has met and seen is a genuine omniscient Buddha, saying, &#39;Let us go right now and pay homage to Gotama Buddha,
who is endowed with undiminished qualities, possessing such special epithets as Buddha, Blessed One, and so on.&#39; Omniscient Buddhas are, in fact, rare and difficult to obtain in the world. Persons like Purana Kassapa and
others, who claimed to be omniscient Buddhas, have ruined many people by imparting false knowledge to them. If the monk Gotama, whom Satagiri saw, is a genuine omniscient Buddha, he must be truly endowed with the quality of
equanimity and unwaveringness in the face of favorable and unfavorable conditions of the world. Therefore, I will first inquire whether he possesses the steadfastness that only Buddhas possess.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">And wishing to ask about the signs of steadfastness (t&#257;di-lakkha&#7751;a), he recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Kacci mano supa&#7751;ihito, sabba-bh&#363;tesu t&#257;dino,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">kacci i&#7789;&#7789;he ani&#7789;&#7789;he ca, sa&#7749;kappassa vas&#299;-kat&#257;?</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Satagiri, what is he like? Is the mind of the Buddha whom you have seen naturally and completely free from love and hatred for all beings and
is it stable as befits one endowed with steadfastness? What is he like? Is the Buddha Gotama whom you have seen able to free himself or overcome the sensual thoughts (k&#257;ma-vitakka), ill-will thoughts (vy&#257;p&#257;da-vitakka)
and cruel thoughts (vihi&#7745;s&#257;-vitakka) which tend to give rise to love and hatred for desirable and undesirable objects?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After this, Satagiri, being absolutely convinced that the Buddha was certainly the omniscient Buddha, and wishing to answer Hemavata&#39;s questions regarding the
full range of qualities of the omniscient Buddha, replied by reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Mano cassa supa&#7751;ihito, sabba-bh&#363;tesu t&#257;dino,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">atho i&#7789;&#7789;he ani&#7789;&#7789;he ca, sa&#7749;kappassa vas&#299;-kat&#257;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Hemavata, the mind of the Buddha whom I have seen is naturally and completely free from love and hatred towards all beings, as befits one endowed
with steadfastness.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Even during the practice and development of the pairs to become a Buddha, the Bodhisatta was endowed with steadfastness, not to mention his steadfastness now
that he has become a Buddha!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">In his life as the elephant king Chaddanta, he had no animosity towards the hunter Sonuttara who intentionally killed him, but instead cut off his own tusks and
gave them to Sonuttara as a gift.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Also in his life as the monkey king, he did not feel hatred even towards the hostile brahmin who hit him on the head with a stone to kill him, but instead, without
anger, showed the brahmin the way out of the forest.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">In his life as the sage Vidhura, he had no hatred for the yaksha Punnaka, who dragged him by the legs and cruelly threw him headfirst into a ravine at the foot
of Mount Kala, 60 yojanas high; he even taught him the Dhamma.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">That is why Satagiri boldly gave his answer:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;The mind of the Buddha whom I have seen is naturally and completely free from love and hatred towards all beings, as befits one endowed with steadfastness.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;My friend Hemavata, the Buddha whom I have seen is able to liberate himself or overcome sensual thoughts (k&#257;ma-vitakka), ill-willed thoughts (vy&#257;p&#257;da-vitakka)
and cruel thoughts (vihi&#7745;s&#257;-vitakka), which tend to give rise to love and hatred for desired and undesired objects.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus when Hemavata asked the question, first concerning the doors of the mind or thought (manodv&#257;ra), whether the Buddha was fully endowed with steadfastness,
he received an affirmative answer from Satagiri. Wanting to ask again in order to be more certain whether the purity of the three doors (dv&#257;ra) of actions existed in the Buddha at the present time, or, in other words,
having heard Satagiri&#39;s affirmative answer to the first brief question as to whether the Buddha was endowed with steadfastness concerning the three doors, and wanting to ask the question again in more detail in order to
make the answer more firm, Hemavata asked again, reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Kacci adinna&#7745; n&#257;diyati, kacci p&#257;&#7751;esu sa&ntilde;&ntilde;ato,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">kacci &#257;r&#257; pam&#257;damh&#257;, kacci jh&#257;na&#7745; na ri&ntilde;cati?</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The Buddha refrained from taking what is not given (adinn&#257;d&#257;na) and other forms of wrong conduct not only in his last life as a Buddha, but throughout the

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The Buddha refrained from verbal misconduct not only in his last life as a Buddha, but throughout the long period in the past he refrained from lying and other verbal
misconduct. Due to the merit of refraining from misconduct in words, he is endowed with such marks of a Great Man as one hair growing in each pore, hair between the eyebrows (u&#7751;&#7751;a-loma), and others. The whole world

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Hemavata, having heard the affirmative answer regarding purity of speech and wishing to ask whether the Buddha at present possessed purity of mind, had overcome ignorance
and was endowed with five eyes, asked, reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Kacci na rajjati k&#257;mesu, kacci citta&#7745; an&#257;vila&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Sagari, what is he like? Is the Buddha you have seen free from greed (abhijjh&#257;) for the five material objects of sense pleasure? Is the mind
of the Buddha you have seen free from the unwholesome mental state aroused by hatred (vy&#257;p&#257;da)? Has the Buddha you have seen really overcome the fourfold delusion (moha), which is the root cause of wrong view (micch&#257;-di&#7789;&#7789;hi)?
Is he really endowed with the eye of wisdom that penetrates all phenomena without obstruction?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Even before realizing the fruit of Arhatship and even at the moment of attaining the path of Non-return, the Buddha had become free from the defilement of craving
for sense objects and also free from the defilement of ill will, the unwholesome mental state, because he had already abandoned the defilement of sense pleasure (k&#257;ma-r&#257;ga-kilesa) and the defilement of ill will (vy&#257;p&#257;da-kilesa).
Even at the moment of attaining Stream-Entry, he was already one who had overcome ignorance, because he had already abandoned the delusion that conceals the four truths, which is the cause of wrong view (micch&#257;-di&#7789;&#7789;hi).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">He had already earned the title of Buddha and had also realized the knowledge of insight, since he had realized the four truths by himself, through his own knowledge.
Therefore, Satagiri, wishing to boldly proclaim the fact that the Buddha had purity in regard to his consciousness and, having attained omniscience, was a genuine Buddha, responded by reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Na so rajjati k&#257;mesu, atho citta&#7745; an&#257;vila&#7745;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">sabba-moha&#7745; atikkanto, Buddho dhammesu cakkhum&#257;</span></em><span

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Hemavata, the Buddha I have seen is truly free from greed for material objects and sensual pleasures. The mind of the Buddha I have seen is also

 class="tm13">2</span></a><a id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm13">, which is the root cause of wrong views. Because he has penetrated all phenomena with independent knowledge, he has
earned the title of Buddha and is also endowed with the fivefold vision.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus Hemavata was extremely pleased and rejoiced to hear and know that the Buddha had purity in regard to the three sense spheres and was a genuine omniscient Buddha.
Being himself endowed with the blessing of great learning (b&#257;hu-sacca-ma&#7749;gala) in his previous life at the time of Buddha Kassapa, and therefore an eloquent, learned speaker with very pure knowledge and wisdom,
and wishing to hear again about the further wonderful and extraordinary qualities of the Buddha, he asked, reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Kacci vijj&#257;ya sampanno, kacci sa&#7745;suddha-c&#257;ra&#7751;o,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Satagiri, is the Buddha you have seen endowed with the eye of understanding (vijj&#257;) that all Buddhas must have? Is he really endowed with
the fifteenfold pure conduct, like good legs used for ascending to Nibb&#257;na? Is the Buddha you have seen already free from the four defilements (&#257;sava)? Is the Buddha you have seen free from the possibility of appearing
in a new existence or being reborn?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After this, Satagiri, because he had deep and firm faith in the Buddha and a desire to confirm that the Buddha was fully endowed with all the qualities that Hemavata
had asked about, replied by reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Vijj&#257;ya ceva sampanno, atho sa&#7745;suddha-c&#257;ra&#7751;o,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">sabbassa &#257;sav&#257; kh&#299;&#7751;&#257;, natthi tassa punabbhavo.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Hemavata, the Buddha I have seen is truly endowed with the eye of understanding that all Buddhas must be endowed with. He also truly possesses
the fifteenfold pure conduct, like good legs used for the path to Nibbana. The Buddha I have seen is already free from the four defilements. The Buddha I have seen is free from the possibility of appearing in a new existence.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then Hemavata became free from doubts about the Buddha, thinking thus:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;The Buddha whom Satagiri has just seen is the true Buddha, the Completely Self-Awakened One and the supreme one in the three worlds.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">So, still remaining in the sky, he recited this verse to praise the Buddha and please Satagiri:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Sampanna&#7745; Munino citta&#7745;, kammun&#257; byappathena ca,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Satagiri, the mind of the Buddha whom you have seen is endowed with steadfastness. He is endowed with purity of action, word and thought. My friend
Satagiri, you have rightly praised the Buddha who is endowed with the three understandings (vijj&#257;), the eight understandings and the fifteen modes of good conduct (cara&#7751;a)&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then Satagiri, with the intention of once again pleasing Hemavata, recited this verse, meaning:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">&quot;My friend Hemavata, what you have said is quite true. Now you, my friend, fully know the qualities of the Buddha and are very happy&quot;:</span></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">And having said this and intending to induce Hemavata to go with him to the Buddha, Satagiri asked with this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Sampanna&#7745; Munino citta&#7745;, kammun&#257; byappathena ca,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Hemavata, the mind of the Buddha whom I have seen is endowed with steadfastness. He is endowed with purity of action, word and thought. Let us

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then Hemavata, as one who had acquired the power of great learning in his previous existence, wished to speak in praise of the qualities of the Buddha that had attracted
him, and to invite Satagiri to go with him and see the Buddha. Thus he recited the following verses:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">E&#7751;i-ja&#7749;gha&#7745; kisa&#7745; v&#299;ra&#7745;, app&#257;h&#257;ra&#7745; alolupa&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Come, Satagiri, let us go. Let us behold a Buddha of the Gotama family, whose calves are round like those of an antelope (e&#7751;&#299;) living in the
upper reaches of the forest; whose limbs and other parts of the body, large and small, are respectively long in five respects, short in four, small in four, tall in six, and round where they should be round; who is diligent
and able to withstand and fight against dangers from within and without the body; who takes only one meal a day just for the maintenance of his body; who has gotten rid of excessive thirst (loluppa-ta&#7751;h&#257;) for food;
who is in full possession of the knowledge of the four paths; and who habitually dwells in absorption in the secluded forest.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">S&#299;ha&#7745;veka-cara&#7745; n&#257;ga&#7745;, k&#257;mesu anapekkhina&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;My friend Satagiri, let us go to the presence of the Buddha who, like the lion king Kesara, cannot be easily approached by ordinary people; who can endure
the vicissitudes of the world; who is fearless; who is the only Buddha to appear in the universe; who, like the elephant king Chaddanta, is endowed with great physical and intellectual strength; and who is free from all desire
and passion for all objects of sense pleasure. Let us ask him about Nibbana, which will surely free us from the round of suffering in the three planes of existence, from the snare of the King of Death.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus Hemavata induced Satagiri and a retinue of 1000 yakshas to come with him to worship the Buddha and listen to the sermon.</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="axwea0sernjm6"></a></span><span class="tm23">Two Yakshas are going to Buddha</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Satagiri and Hemavata, accompanied by their 1000 yaksha followers, reached the Deer Park at Isipatana in the city of Baranasi at midnight. And having approached and
paid homage to the Buddha, who had not changed his posture but was still sitting cross-legged as when preaching the Wheel of Dhamma, they recited this verse to praise the Buddha and to ask permission to ask him questions:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Akkh&#257;-t&#257;ra&#7745; pavatt&#257;ra&#7745;, sabba-dhamm&#257;na&#39; p&#257;ragu&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;To the Buddha Gotama, who preaches the four noble truths, both briefly and in detail; who is fully endowed with knowledge of all things (dhamma) in six

of absorptions (jh&#257;na-sam&#257;patti); who has awakened from the slumber of delusion (moha); and who has freed himself from the five wrong paths, such as taking life (p&#257;&#7751;&#257;tip&#257;t&#257;) and others,
may we have your permission to ask you about what we do not know?&quot;</span></em></p>
<h2 class="tm37"><span class="tm21"><a id="am18wbfvaeuck"></a><br /></span><span class="tm23">The question of the origin of the world of beings and conditioned things<br /></span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After receiving permission, Hemavata, who had the greater strength and wisdom of the two, asked questions about what was unknown to them, reciting the following verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Kismi&#7745; loko samuppanno, kismi&#7745; kubbati santhava&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Blessed Buddha, in the presence of the arising of what do the two worlds come into being: the world of living beings (satta-loka) and the world of conditioned
things (sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra-loka)? In what do all beings, such as humans, devas, and brahmas, closely associate themselves with craving and wrong views (ta&#7751;h&#257;-di&#7789;&#7789;hi), thinking &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;?
Thereupon, the world of living beings and the world of conditioned things are so called? In the arising of what do all beings, such as humans, devas, and brahmas, become miserable?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then the Buddha, intending to answer the question put by Hemavata, relying on the six internal sense organs: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind (ajjhattik-&#257;yatana)
and the six external sense objects: form, sound, smell, taste, touch and ideas formed in the mind, replied by reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">When the loko is samuppanno, when the kubbati is santhava&#7745;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Hemavata, when the six internal organs and the six external objects arise, two worlds arise: the world of living beings and the world of conditioned things.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">From the standpoint of absolute truth (paramattha-dhamma), the world of living beings, men, devas and brahmas, is simply a composite of these twelve spheres, namely,
the six inner ones - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind; and the six outer ones - form, sound, smell, taste, contact and the idea formed in the mind. Without these twelve spheres there can be no such thing as a being, whether
man, deva or brahma. From the standpoint of absolute truth, the world of conditioned things, meaning such things as fields, land, gold, silver, rice and so on, consists of only the six outer spheres. Without these six there
can be no world of inanimate conditioned things. Hence the Buddha&#39;s answer: Chasu loko samuppanno...,&nbsp;</span><em><span
 class="tm35">&quot;when the six inner and six outer spheres arise, two worlds arise - the world of living beings and the world of inanimate conditioned things.&quot;</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">All beings, that is, men, devas and brahmas, who in close friendship with craving and wrong views take &#39;I&#39;, &#39;other&#39;, &#39;man&#39;, &#39;woman&#39;,
&#39;field&#39;, &#39;earth&#39; and so on as &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;, are, from the standpoint of absolute truth, composites of the same six inner and six outer spheres. This is the truth. Taking the eye as &#39;I&#39;
and &#39;mine&#39;, beings are friends with craving and wrong views; taking the ear as &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;, they are friends with craving and wrong views; they do the same with the nose, the tongue, the body, the
mind, and with forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches such as hardness or softness, heat or cold, and the ideas that arise in the mind. Hence the Buddha&#39;s answer: Chasu kubbati santhava&#7745;... &quot;In the six inner
and six outer realms, all beings, humans, devas and brahmas, closely associate themselves with craving and wrong views through the concepts of &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine.&#39;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Hemavata, the six inner and six outer spheres, are the so-called world of living beings and the world of conditioned things.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">In relation to the above-mentioned twelve spheres, there arose such names as &quot;Humans&quot;, &quot;Devas&quot;, &quot;Brahmas&quot;, that is, the world of living
beings, and such names as &quot;field&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;rice&quot;, &quot;paddy&quot; and so on - the world of inanimate conditioned things.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Hemavata, when the six internal and six external spheres are clearly manifest, all living entities, namely human beings, devas and brahmas, become unhappy.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">According to the Discourse on Burning (&#256;ditta-pariy&#257;ya-sutta, SN 35.28), the twelve realms are ablaze with the eleven fires of greed, hatred, and delusion
(r&#257;ga-dosa-moha) and others. From the standpoint of ultimate truth, the world of sentient beings, consisting of humans, devas, and brahmas, is also simply these twelve realms, the six inner and the six outer. These realms
are also constantly and separately ablaze with the eleven fires. Because there are realms, there is burning; because there is burning, there is suffering. If there were no realms, there would be no burning; if there were no
burning, there would be no suffering. That is why the Buddha replied thus: Chasu loko viha&ntilde;&ntilde;ati...&nbsp;</span><em><span
 class="tm35">&quot;when the six inner and six outer realms are clearly manifest, all beings, that is, humans, devas, and brahmas, become miserable.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After this, Hemavata, being unable to clearly remember the brief answer given by the Buddha to his question about the round of suffering, and wishing to know both
the enumeration of the spheres and their opposites contained in the Buddha&#39;s answer, recited the following verse to ask about the round of suffering (va&#7789;&#7789;a) and the cessation of the round of suffering (viva&#7789;&#7789;a):</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Katama&#7745; ta&#7745; up&#257;d&#257;na&#7745;, yattha loko viha&ntilde;&ntilde;ati,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">niyy&#257;na&#7745; pucchito br&#363;hi, katha&#7745; dukkh&#257; pamuccati?</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&#8220;Blessed Buddha, if, according to the answer: Chasu loko viha&ntilde;&ntilde;ati... &#39;living beings, that is, humans, devas and brahmas, become unhappy
due to the existence of the six realms,&#39; how are these six the cause of suffering for beings?&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">This directly asks about the truth of suffering (dukkha-sacca); by asking about the truth of suffering, one also asks about the truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya-sacca).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&#8220;What is the factor that brings about liberation from the cycle of suffering? How can liberation from the cycle of suffering be realized? May the Buddha,
who has been thus approached with the question of liberation from the cycle of suffering, have the mercy to answer us.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The second half of this verse directly asks about the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (magga-sacca); and in asking about the truth of the
path leading to the cessation of suffering, one also asks about the truth of the cessation of suffering, that is, Nibbana (nirodha-sacca).</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">When Hemavata asked about the four noble truths, mentioning the truth of suffering and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering explicitly, and
the truth of the origin of suffering and the truth of the cessation of suffering implicitly, the Buddha recited the following verse to answer the questions posed by Hemavata:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Pa&ntilde;ca k&#257;ma-gu&#7751;&#257; loke, mano-cha&#7789;&#7789;h&#257; pavedit&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">ettha chanda&#7745; vir&#257;jetv&#257;, eva&#7745; dukkh&#257; pamuccati.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Hemavata, I have clearly shown the five sense pleasures of form, sound, smell, taste and touch, with the mind as the sixth in the world (k&#257;ma-gu&#7751;a).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">By the word &#39;mind&#39; in the first half of this verse the mental sphere (man&#257;yatana) is directly taught; and by teaching the mental sphere the object of
the mind (dhamm&#257;yatana) is also taught. By the five sense pleasures (k&#257;ma-gu&#7751;a) of form, sound, odour, taste and touch the five objects (&#257;yatana) are directly taught: the form object, the sound object,
the odour object, the taste object and the touch object; and by teaching these five sense objects their five recipients are also taught: the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue and the body. Thus by the first half of this verse
the six internal spheres (ajjhittik&#257;yatana) and the six external spheres (b&#257;hir&#257;yatana) are taught, twelve in all; these spheres may be called clinging (up&#257;d&#257;na), which forms the suffering of the world
of living beings.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Hemavata, the thirst and desire (ta&#7751;h&#257;-chanda) for the totality of these twelve realms, the circle of suffering and the truth of suffering, must be
completely eliminated and destroyed.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">For their elimination and destruction, they must first be distinguished either as aggregates (pa&ntilde;caskangha), or as spheres (ayatana), or as elements (dhatu),
or briefly as mind and matter (nama-rupa). They must be meditated upon for insight (vipasan&#257;), subjecting them to the test of the three characteristics (anica, anata, dukkha). Their elimination and destruction ultimately
occurs through insight, which culminates in the path of the fruit of Arahant. By eliminating and destroying them, one is freed from the cycle of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The second half of the verse answers the question of cessation (viva&#7789;&#7789;a), and also shows the truth of the path (magga-sacca). The truth of origination
(samudaya-sacca) and cessation (nirodha-sacca) are considered to be answered, as they were briefly stated in the previous answer in the verse.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">In other words, the first half of the verse shows the truth of suffering; by the term desire and passion (chanda-r&#257;ga) in the second half of the verse, the arising
of suffering is shown. From the word &#39;having removed&#39; (vir&#257;jetv&#257;) is derived dispassion (vir&#257;ga), which is Nibbana, the cessation of craving, and also the truth of cessation (nirodha-sacca). By the word
&#39;thus&#39; (eva&#7745;) the truth of the path (magga-sacca) is shown, for it signifies the course of practice in the eightfold path leading to liberation from the suffering of Samsara. Thus the four truths are proclaimed
by the Buddha in this verse.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The Buddha thus showed the excellent way of exit, which is the eightfold path as the means of escape from the round of births and deaths. And again, because he wished
to conclude his answer on the way of exit in natural language, he recited the following verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Eta&#7745; lokassa niyy&#257;na&#7745;, akkh&#257;ta&#7745; vo yath&#257;-tatha&#7745;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">eta&#7745; vo aham-akkh&#257;mi, eva&#7745; dukkh&#257; pamuccati.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Hemavata, I have taught you this means, the Eightfold Path, which can lead to liberation from the conditioned world of the three elements (tedh&#257;tuka-sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra-loka),
such as the element of sensual pleasures (k&#257;ma-dh&#257;tu), the element of materiality (r&#363;pa-dh&#257;tu), and the element of immateriality (ar&#363;pa-dh&#257;tu). Since there can be no liberation from the suffering
of the round of birth and death except through this Eightfold Path, and since there is no other path of liberation, even if you were to ask 1000 times, I will tell you only this: this Eightfold Path is the only excellent Dhamma
for liberation from the round of birth and death. Or, since there can be liberation from the suffering of the round of birth and death only through the Eightfold Path, and since there is no other path of liberation, I will
speak only of the Eightfold Path as the only excellent The Dhamma that leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, to enable you, who have already realized the lower paths and fruits, to realize the higher ones.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<h2 class="tm20"><span class="tm21"><a id="axmhzs4xlw7xs"></a></span><span class="tm23">Yakshas became &#8220;Stream Enterers&#8221;</span></h2>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus the Buddha perfectly completed the discourse of the Dhamma, which reached its culmination in the fruit of Arahant (Arahatta-phala). At the end of this discourse,
the two yak&#7779;as, Satagiri and Hemavata, were established in the fruit of stream entry, together with their retinue of 1,000 yak&#7779;as.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After this, Hemavata, being one who by nature had due respect and devotion to the Dhamma, and now established as a noble Stream Enterer, was not fully satisfied with
the wonderful Dhamma of the Buddha, which was perfect both in letter and in spirit. Therefore, desiring to know the two causes: the cause of becoming inferior noble ones (sekkha-bh&#363;mi-dhamma) and the cause of becoming
Arahants (asekkha-bh&#363;mi-dhamma), he addressed the Buddha, reciting the following verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Ko s&#363;dha tarati ogha&#7745;, kodha tarati a&#7751;&#7751;ava&#7745;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">appati&#7789;&#7789;he an&#257;lambe, ko gambh&#299;re na s&#299;dati?</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Blessed Buddha, who in the world, endowed with virtuous conduct, is able to cross the turbulent waters of the four streams? Who, endowed with virtuous conduct
in this world, is able to cross the wide and deep ocean of Sa&#7745;s&#257;ra? Who can remain whole and unharmed without drowning in the bottomless ocean of Sa&#7745;s&#257;ra, where there is nothing below to stand on and
nothing above to grab hold of?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The first half of this verse asked about the reason for becoming noble from the lower classes, and the second half asked about the reason for becoming Arahats.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then the Buddha recited the following verse, wishing to answer the reason for the lower becoming noble:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Sabbad&#257; s&#299;la-sampanno, pa&ntilde;&ntilde;av&#257; susam&#257;hito,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Hemavata, the monk who is endowed with morality constantly, without transgressing the precepts, but with care for their observance even at the risk of life;
who is also endowed with mundane and supramundane knowledge; who is also steadfast in access concentration (upac&#257;ra-sam&#257;dhi) and full concentration (appan&#257;-sam&#257;dhi); who by means of insight knowledge (vipassan&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
constantly meditates on the mental and physical aggregates known internally as his own (niyakajjhatta), applying the three characteristics; who is also possessed of mindfulness (sati), enabling him to practice continually
the threefold training (sikkh&#257;), namely, virtue, concentration, and wisdom (s&#299;la-sam&#257;dhi-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;); he, thus endowed with this threefold training, is able to cross the turbulent expanses of the
four streams, which is difficult for ordinary people to do.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After the Buddha gave an answer about the cause of becoming lower noble, he recited the following verse to give an answer about the cause of becoming Arahants:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">Virato k&#257;ma-sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;ya, sabba-sa&#7745;yojan&#257;tigo,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm35">&quot;Hemavata, the monk who has attained complete abstinence from all perceptions accompanied by craving for the material objects of sense pleasures; who has
also broken and cast off the long belt of the ten attachments by means of the four paths; in whom the three types of craving and the three states of existence, collectively called enjoyments (nand&#299;), have completely dried
up; who is an Arahant fully endowed with these qualities, he does not drown in the vast and bottomless ocean of Sa&#7745;s&#257;ra, where there is nothing below to stand on and nothing above to grasp.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">He has now attained with the greatest ease Nibbana with remainder (sa-up&#257;disesa-nibb&#257;na), because his thirst is exhausted, and he is on the verge of Nibbana
without remainder (anup&#257;disesa-nibb&#257;na) due to the cessation of existence. Thus his landing is with the greatest ease and comfort, and he is one who does not sink.</span></p>

Buddha. Together with his friend Satagiri and the retinue of a thousand Yakshas, he paid homage to the Buddha with due respect and devotion and returned home. The five verses of praise and veneration were:</span></p>
