<p class="tm14"><strong><span class="tm15">The Bodhisattva&#39;s Visit to Rajagaha</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">After becoming a recluse, the Bodhisattva spent seven full days in a nearby Mango grove called Anupiya, and then traveled 30 yojanas on foot in a single day, entering the city of Rajagaha.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">As he was about to visit Rajagaha to collect alms, he stopped at the eastern gate of the city and reflected: &quot;If I inform King Bimbisara of my arrival, he will know that Prince Siddhattha,
son of King Suddhodana, has visited his city. Then he will show due respect and care and offer me many gifts. However, as an ascetic, I should not inform him of my arrival and receive the four requisites. Now I must go on
an alms round.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">So, wearing the patchwork robe gifted by Brahma Ghatikara and holding a bowl, the Bodhisattva entered the city through the eastern gate and began his journey from house to house, collecting
alms.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">For seven days before the Bodhisattva entered Rajagaha, a large-scale festival was being held. On the day the Bodhisattva entered the city, King Bimbisara ordered a proclamation to be made
to the people by beating a drum: &quot;The festival is over! Now people should attend to their affairs.&quot; At this time, the city&#39;s inhabitants were still gathered in the square in front of the palace. When the king
opened the window supported by a lion figure and looked out to give necessary instructions, he saw the Bodhisattva entering Rajagaha for alms, with well-restrained senses.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The inhabitants of Rajagaha were filled with anxiety when they saw the Bodhisattva&#39;s incomparably beautiful form. The whole city was thrown into commotion, as if it were the time when
the elephant Nalagiri, known as Dhanapala, had stepped on its lands, or when the inhabitants of the celestial Tavatimsa, alarmed and worried, greeted Vepacitti, the lord of asuras, when he entered their abode.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">As the noble Bodhisattva, like the elephant king Chaddanta, gracefully made his rounds in Rajagaha, the city&#39;s inhabitants were struck by his refined and majestic appearance. They began
to discuss who he might be: some suggested he could be the god Kama or Sakka, the lord of devas, while others believed they were seeing Brahma himself. However, one sage interrupted their debate, stating that before them stood
an outstanding human being.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">While the inhabitants of Rajagaha were discussing among themselves, the royal servants went to King Bimbisara and reported: &quot;Great king, in our city of Rajagaha, an amazing man is going
for alms, about whom no one knows anything, whether he is a celestial being, a gandhabba, a naga, or a yakkha.&quot; Hearing their words, the king, who had already seen the Bodhisattva while standing on the upper terrace of
the palace, was intrigued and sent his ministers with an order: &quot;Go and find out who this man is. If he is a gandhabba, he will fly through the air; if a yakkha, he will disappear beyond the city; if a naga, he will go
into the earth and vanish. If he is a real human, he will go to some place and eat his food.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">With sensory organs and mind well collected and concentrated, with his gaze lowered and directed just a few steps ahead, captivating the eyes of Rajagaha&#39;s inhabitants, he went from house
to house collecting food to sustain himself. Then he asked the people: &quot;Where do those ascetics who come to this city usually stay?&quot; The people replied: &quot;They usually stay at the entrance of the east-facing
cave at the top of Mount Pandava.&quot; Thus, the noble Bodhisattva left the city through the eastern gate through which he had entered. Then he sat, facing east, at the entrance of the cave on the mountain and attempted to
eat the mixed food of coarse and fine fare he had received.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Having recently enjoyed royal bliss as great as that of a Universal Monarch, he tried to eat a piece of food representing a mixture of coarse and fine products of different colors. When he
was about to put this piece in his mouth, he felt disgust and almost spat out the food, as he had never seen such food in his life and it seemed particularly repulsive to him.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Then he reproached himself, saying: &quot;You, Siddhattha, despite occupying such a high position in the palace, where food and drink were available at your wish, and where you ate three-year-aged
fragrant rice with various delicacies when you wanted, you, upon seeing a recluse in patchwork robes, pondered: &#39;When will I eat food obtained by going around houses for alms, becoming a recluse like him? When will the
time come for me to live on food collected in this way?&#39; And did you not leave the world and become a recluse with such thoughts? Now that your dream has come true, why do you behave like this?&quot; Then, without the
slightest aversion, he ate this coarse and unappetizing food.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The three ministers sent by King Bimbisara approached the Bodhisattva and ascertained all the facts about him. Then two of the three remained, while the third returned to the king and reported:
&quot;Great king, that ascetic who was collecting alms is still sitting calmly at the entrance of the east-facing cave at the top of Mount Pandava, absolutely fearless, like a lion king, tiger king, or bull king, after eating
the food he collected in the usual manner.&quot; Hearing this, King Bimbisara hurried on a magnificent chariot to the place where the Bodhisattva was, as far as he could go by chariot; then, leaving the chariot, he continued
on foot.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">When he approached the Bodhisattva, with his permission, he sat on the cold stone slab and, being very impressed by the Bodhisattva&#39;s behavior, joyfully began to speak with him. He said:
&quot;Friend, you are still young and tender. You also possess a beautiful physique and special characteristics. I think you are from a good lineage, belonging to the pure ruling class. I offer you as much royal pleasure and
wealth as you desire in these two countries of Anga and Magadha, which are under my rule. Be a king and share power with me! Please also tell me about your origin.&quot; Thus the king inquired about the Bodhisattva and offered
him the kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Then the Bodhisattva thought: &quot;If I wanted to become a king, such deva kings as the Four Great Kings of the celestial world and others would offer me their respective royal wealth. Or,
if I had continued to live a royal life in my palace, I would surely have become a Universal Monarch. Not knowing this, King Bimbisara has made me such an offer. I will now make him understand about my royal life.&#8221; Thinking
thus, he stretched out his right hand, pointing in the direction from which he came, and then spoke in verses: </span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">(Snp 421-423, PTS 73).</span></p>
<p class="tm14"><em><span class="tm16"></span></em><strong><span class="tm15">Uju&#7745; janapado r&#257;ja, Himavantassa passato, dhana-viriyena sampanno Kosalesu niketino.</span></strong><span
 class="tm12"> <br /></span><em><span class="tm16">Directly to the north of Mount Himavanta, O king, there is a country full of wealth and power, where the Kosalans live.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm14"><em><span class="tm16"></span></em><strong><span class="tm15">&#256;dicc&#257; n&#257;ma gottena, S&#257;kiy&#257; n&#257;ma j&#257;tiy&#257;, tamh&#257; kul&#257; pabbajitomhi, na k&#257;me abhipatthaya&#7745;.</span></strong><span
 class="tm12"> </span><em><span class="tm16"><br />lineage is of the Adicca clan, and I am a Sakya by birth. From that family, I have left the world, not desiring sensual pleasures.</span></em></p>

mano.</span></strong><span class="tm12"> <br /></span><em><span class="tm16">Having seen the danger in sensual pleasures and perceiving renunciation as peace, I have decided to direct my efforts towards spiritual practice.
In this lies my goal and aspiration.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">With these three verses, the Bodhisattva informed King Bimbisara that he was of the Sakya clan and had adopted the life of an ascetic; that he had no desire for material pleasures; and that,
having become a recluse with the aim of attaining Nibbana, he intended to seclude himself in the forest to practice asceticism (dukkara-cariy&#257;) in order to achieve this state of Nibbana more quickly.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Hearing this, King Bimbisara replied: &quot;Venerable sir, I have already heard that Prince Siddhattha, son of King Suddhodana, upon seeing four signs with his own eyes, renounced worldly
life to become a recluse and attain Perfect Self-Awakening, the highest in the three worlds. Having seen with my own eyes your great aspiration for Nibbana, I firmly believe that you will become a Buddha. Venerable sir, allow
me to make a request. When you become a Buddha, please visit my country first!&quot; After King Bimbisara had thus solemnly expressed his invitation, he returned to the city.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Now let&#39;s look at this story as it is written in the Pali Canon.</span></p>
<p class="tm14"><span class="tm12">Pabbajja Sutta (Snp 3.1):</span></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">The Going Forth</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">I will tell of the going forth, How He with Vision went forth, How He reasoned and chose The going forth as beneficial. (1)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Household life is crowded, dusty; Going forth is wide open&quot;: Seeing thus, he went forth. On going forth, he avoided Evil deeds in body. (2)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Abandoning verbal misconduct, He purified his livelihood. Then he, the Buddha, went to Rajagaha, The mountain fortress of the Magadhans, (3)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">And walked for alms in his splendor, Endowed with the foremost marks. King Bimbisara saw him From the terrace of his palace. (4)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Seeing his marks, [the king] said this: &quot;Look at this one, sirs. How handsome, stately, pure! How consummate his conduct! (5)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Mindful, his eyes downcast, Looking only a plow-length before him. This one&#39;s not from a lowly lineage: Send the royal messengers to follow And see where this monk will go.&quot;
(6)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">They followed behind him: &quot;Where will this monk go? Where will his dwelling place be?&quot; As he went from house to house, Restrained, his senses well-controlled, (7)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Mindful, alert, His bowl quickly filled. Then he, the sage, left the city, Heading for Mount Pandava: &quot;That&#39;s where his dwelling will be.&quot; (8)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Seeing he had entered his dwelling, The messengers approached. One messenger returned And reported to the king: (9)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">&quot;This monk, your majesty, On the east side of Pandava, Sits like a tiger, a bull, A lion in a mountain cleft.&quot; (10)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Hearing the messenger&#39;s words, The noble warrior king Hurriedly went by royal coach, Out to Mount Pandava. (11)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Going as far as the coach would go, He got down, went on foot, Approached the monk, And sat down. (12)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">Sitting there, he exchanged Courteous greetings. Then he said: &quot;You are young, youthful, (13)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">In the first stage of life, Endowed with the stature and coloring Of noble warriors. You would look glorious (14)</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm14"><strong><em><span class="tm19">In the vanguard of an army, With an elephant squadron. I offer you wealth: enjoy it. I ask of your birth: inform me.&quot; (15)</span></em></strong></p>

<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">&#160;Bhikkhu Bodhi&#39;s commentary on the Pabbajja Sutta (Snp 3.1):</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The Pabbajja Sutta and its continuation, the Padhana Sutta (Snp 3.2), as well as the introductory verses of the Nalaka Sutta (Snp 3.11), are the earliest attempts to recount the main events
of the Buddha&#39;s life in verse form.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">Since each of these texts relates to a specific event, it would be an exaggeration to say that the texts represent a primitive biography of the Buddha. Nevertheless, they clearly provide
material for compiling such a biography.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The narrative part of the Pabbajja Sutta, according to the Commentary, was spoken by Ananda, but the core of the text is a dialogue between the future Buddha and King Bimbisara, which took
place on Pandava Hill near the city of Rajagaha.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">According to the Commentary, the Buddha went to Rajagaha soon after leaving household life. The Commentary on the Jataka states that after arriving in Anupiya, he spent the first week enjoying
the bliss of seclusion, and then left for Rajagaha, making a 200-mile journey in one day. Based on this, it appears that the meeting with Bimbisara took place before the Buddha became a disciple of Alara Kalama (as described
in MN 26).</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The style of the Pabbajja Sutta is simple and unadorned. There are no embellishments or external additions. The Buddha himself is referred to as &quot;Buddha,&quot; although the events in
the sutta take place before his enlightenment. He is also not mentioned as &quot;bodhisatta.&quot; Several times the Buddha is called a monk (bhikkhu), and once a sage (muni).</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">When asked about his origin, he does not identify himself as the son of a king, as later legend does, but acknowledges that the Sakyan state was under the protectorate of the Kosalans.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">There is a parallel with the Sanskrit version of the Pabbajja Sutta in the Mahavastu, as well as with another version of the sutta in Chinese in the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka school. This
indicates that the story of the meeting between the future Buddha and King Bimbisara was known to several different schools of early Buddhism.</span></p>
<p class="tm18"><span class="tm12">The next time the Buddha meets Bimbisara is after he begins teaching the Dhamma (Vin I 37). In this case, the Buddha teaches the Dhamma to King Bimbisara and his retinue. They all achieve
the lower level of awakening &#8211; stream-entry.</span></p>
