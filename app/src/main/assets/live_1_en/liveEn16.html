 id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u></strong></p>
<p class="tm27"><br /><br /><span class="tm16">When the Bodhisatta sat on the unsurpassed (apar&#257;jita) throne at the tree of Great Awakening (Mah&#257; Bodhi) in order to attain omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),
Sakka&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote2"><span class="tm16">2</span></a><a id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm16">came to pay homage and stood blowing the Vijayuttara conch shell, 120 cubits long, the sound of which ceased only after four months. Deva Pancasikha paid homage playing the harp made of beluva wood, Deva Suyama
stood waving a yak tail fan, Deva Santusita stood with a fan in his hands, and Brahma Sahampati held a white umbrella three yojanas long.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">The Naga King Kala arrived with 80,000 Nagas and paid homage by reciting hundreds of verses in praise of the Bodhisatta. All the devas and Brahmas of the ten thousand
world elements gathered to pay homage, bringing garlands of fragrant flowers and incense, and singing songs of praise.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">Vasavatti Mara, having given up his heavenly pleasures, followed the Bodhisatta all this time during six years of severe austerities, waiting for the moment when
the Bodhisatta might have wrong or evil thoughts (micch&#257;-vitakka), such as thoughts about sensual pleasures (k&#257;ma-vitakka). But not finding the slightest deviation from right thoughts in the Bodhisatta, Mara thought:
&#8220;Now Siddhattha has attained the Bodhi tree to become a Buddha. At present he is striving to escape from my power. I cannot allow him to leave the three worlds under my control.&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote3"><span class="tm16">3</span></a><a id="footnote3back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm16">&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">With this thought he went to the abode of Vasavatti and, gathering his warrior forces, he commanded: &quot;Maras, assume fearsome forms and proceed towards Prince
Siddhattha, like a great torrent of water falling with incredible force.&quot; He himself followed them, riding the elephant Girimehala, measuring 150 yojanas. Having created a thousand hands, he held a different weapon in
each of them.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm28">Mara, mentioned here, was not the legitimate ruler of the kingdom of Vasavatti. The legitimate ruler of Vasavatti was another deva. Just as a rebellious leader
with many followers in the human world actively rebels against the state by plundering and committing robberies, Mara was actually only a powerful inhabitant of the abode of Paranimmitavasavatti, leading a rebellion there
with a large retinue of evil devas. They created great obstacles for the men, devas and brahmas in their performance of pious activities.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">The Bodhisattva was surrounded by such a huge army of Maras that their depth was twelve yojanas, their width on the right side was twelve yojanas, on the left side
twelve yojanas, and their height above him was nine yojanas. Behind them they extended to the very edge of the ten thousand world system&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote4"><span class="tm16">4</span></a><a id="footnote4back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm16">. The terrifying cries and noise of the numerous armies of the Maras could be heard at a distance
of a thousand yojanas, resembling the sounds of a huge landslide. Mara himself, holding a thousand different weapons in his thousand created hands, and his numerous troops, each with a different weapon, transformed themselves
into terrifying figures with diverse faces and advanced on the Bodhisatta to crush him.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">When the vast armies of the Maras thus approached the tree of Great Awakening (Mah&#257; Bodhi), none of the devas&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote5"><span class="tm16">5</span></a><a id="footnote5back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm16">, including Sakka, who had previously paid homage to the Bodhisatta, could not bear it. They
fled in different directions. There was not a single deva or brahma who dared to remain near the Bodhisatta and the tree of Great Awakening. At this time, the Bodhisatta remained sitting alone, like the Great Brahma in a secluded
abode.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">Clear omens of evil foreshadowed Mara&#39;s approach. These omens included: the fall of meteors; the onset of total darkness with the appearance of fog; a violent
shaking of the oceans and the great earth; the appearance of darkness over the oceans; the flow of some rivers going in the opposite direction; rocks falling from the mountains; trees being overturned; violent storms and winds;
the appearance of terrifying sounds caused by these winds; the disappearance of the sun in the darkness and the appearance in the sky and in the darkness of headless bodies. When Mara appeared with these clear omens, the Bodhisatta
remained seated without the slightest fear, like Garuda among birds or the lion-king Kesaraja among beasts.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">Even with the appearance of the above-mentioned ominous omens, Mara remained at a distance, not daring to approach the immediate vicinity of the Great Awakening Tree.
Not daring to approach, Mara&#39;s great armies surrounded the Bodhisatta on all sides. Surveying his hordes, Mara could only give orders, but he himself could not approach the Great Awakening Tree, just as a fly cannot approach
a white-hot iron. He said to his troops: &quot;There is no one who can compare with Siddhattha, the son of Rajah Suddhodana. We cannot attack him head-on; we will attack him from the rear.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">Looking around him to the front, left and right, the Bodhisatta saw that all the devas and brahmas had fled. Then, seeing Mara&#39;s troops advancing to attack him
from the north, he thought: &#39;Such a huge number of Mara&#39;s troops are making great efforts for the sole purpose of attacking me. Here in this place, there is neither my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor my
other relatives. Only the ten perfections (pairs) that I have developed and cultivated for so long will serve as my companions and retinue. Therefore, relying only on these companions of mine, the ten perfections, it is right
to destroy these hordes of Maras by attacking them with the weapons of my perfections.&#39; He then concentrated on the merit of the ten perfections.&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote6"><span class="tm16">6</span></a><a id="footnote6back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm16">.</span></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">While the Bodhisatta was reflecting on the merit of his ten perfections (parami), Mara thought: &#8220;to use nine types of weapons.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>

<p class="tm30"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">9. The Great Darkness.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm15">Compassion of the Bodhisattva</span></strong></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">A very compassionate father, to whom his children are indebted, will not show the slightest anger if his little son, playing at his feet, hits him with his hands
and feet or hurts him in any way. Instead of getting angry, he will embrace him and press him to his chest to let him sleep with fatherly love and care.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">In the same way, the noble Bodhisatta showed tolerance towards all the evil deeds of the wicked Mara and did not feel the least bit sad. He looked at Mara without
fear, but with kindness and compassion.</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">&quot;This evil Mara is completely unaware that he himself has fallen into misfortune. Having been born in the abode of Vasavatti merely due to a few good deeds,
he does not even know anything about his own duration of life, the time of his death, or the place of suffering to which he will be condemned after death. Yet he thinks, &#39;I am constant. I am the one who rules the whole
world.&#39;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm16">He does not reflect and is unaware of his own position and the danger of falling into the lower realms. Due to such ignorance, he dares to commit such atrocities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><span class="tm16">Even in the form of a small hare in the animal kingdom, showing the greatest courage, he jumped into a blazing fire to have his meat roasted, and with joy and

<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">Ordinary people might take the Bodhisatta&#39;s bold words, &quot;If the accumulated merits made by beings in all the countless worlds were compared with the merits arising from just
one of my ten perfections, they would not reach even one 256th of the merits of that one perfection,&quot; as an exaggeration. But in fact, this was not the case: these words were quite natural and true.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">People other than the Bodhisatta usually perform good deeds with the desire to attain human or divine happiness. Therefore, their accumulated merits only lead to the continuation of the
cycle of suffering. This is similar to those who spend their wealth on personal needs immediately after receiving it and do not save anything for the future. Thus, all beings other than the Bodhisatta, carried away by the
enjoyment of the cycle of existences (vatt&#257;bhirata), remain poor, lacking wealth accumulated from merit.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">The Bodhisatta, however, aimed exclusively at omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) every time he performed a virtuous action to fulfill the perfections.
As a result, all the merits the Bodhisatta had performed remained intact, without losing their power, in his stream of consciousness until they bore the fruit of omniscience. Thus, just as one who does not squander but saves
his means, daily accumulating more and more wealth, the Bodhisatta, through life after life acquiring an ever-increasing wealth of merit, became extremely rich in terms of his virtuous actions.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">One rich man, possessing a billion-dollar fortune, cannot be compared with many poor people in terms of wealth. They will inevitably lose in this comparison. Likewise, a Bodhisatta, who
is incredibly rich, possessing incalculable wealth of merit accumulated through perfections, cannot be compared with beings from countless world systems. They are doomed to defeat, since they have become impoverished in terms
of merit, having squandered it immediately after receiving it for the sake of acquiring well-being (bhava-sampatti) and enjoying pleasures (bhoga-sampatti). Therefore, the Bodhisatta&#8217;s bold statement is not an exaggeration;
it is natural and true.</span></em></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">&quot;Mara does not know who I really am; that I have acquired this identity of mine in this life due to the mentioned innumerable meritorious deeds. Therefore he thinks that I am an ordinary

<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">&quot;In fact, I am not an ordinary person who has just been born; I am not a yakkha, nor a Brahma, nor a deva. I was born in a human womb in order to reveal the Truths of the Noble Ones
to all living beings.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">It cannot be said with certainty that the Bodhisatta was a human being, a Yakkha, a Deva, a Mara, or a Brahma, since none of these beings perform tasks similar to those performed by the
Bodhisatta.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">The question may then arise, why did the Bodhisatta have to be born of a human woman, Queen Maya? Therefore, it was said that he accepted conception in the womb of a human woman in order
to show all sentient beings - humans, devas and brahmas - the sufferings of old age, illness and death in the cycle of existence.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">There is no Deva, no Mara, no Brahma, no self (atta) that can create or give birth to any sentient being. In reality, it is only the thirst (tanha) that arises in the mental continuum
of every being that is responsible for the repetition of rebirths (patisandhi). It is the force of thirst that leads to the commission of good and bad deeds.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">Action (kamma) is like a field, consciousness (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;ana) is like a seed, and thirst (tanha) or greed (lobha) is like water. Just as a tree sprout appears due to the combination
of soil, seed, and water, so a sentient being appears due to the combination of the soil of action (kamma), the seed of consciousness (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;ana), and the moisture of thirst or greed. In the absence of the moisture
of thirst or greed, even though the soil of action and the seed of consciousness are present, the sprout of the tree of existence will not appear. Therefore, noble arhats who have uprooted the moisture of thirst or greed are
not reborn in a new existence.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">Thus, sentient beings, who arise from the combination of the three causes, are overwhelmed by a stream of various sufferings, such as birth, etc. A Bodhisatta is one who wants to eliminate
all these sufferings that afflict sentient beings.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">The root cause of all sufferings such as birth, etc., is craving (tanha). If craving is eradicated, birth does not occur. If birth does not occur, old age, death, etc., do not occur.
Therefore, craving should be eradicated first of all; and from delusion (moha) this craving arises in sentient beings who seek happiness by perceiving the six sense objects (arammana), such as visible objects (ruparammana),
sounds, tastes, smell, touch, thoughts, as permanent (nicca-sanya), pleasant (sukha-sanya), beautiful (subha-sanya), or unchanging (atta-sanya). And craving can be abandoned only when the defects of the six sense objects,
which are the source of craving, are manifested.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">Again, the faults of the six sense objects mean that they are characterized by a state of impermanence; the state of impermanence, in turn, can be recognized only when the nature of old
age and death is seen from the apparently primitive, simple level; only when a being&#39;s old age and death are seen can one begin to know the teaching, straighten the views, and move along the Eightfold Path and finally
see the true impermanence and faults of the six sense objects and the six sense organs at the deep level of the arising and passing away of mind and matter in each moment; and only when these faults are seen can one abandon
the craving and greed that cling to the six sense objects. Only when craving and greed can be abandoned will the suffering of Samsara, such as birth, old age, and so on, cease. In this case, the initial vision and understanding
of old age and death is the fundamental and most essential factor in the cessation of the suffering of Samsara. And so the Bodhisatta came into this human world and was conceived in the womb of Queen Maya.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">If a Bodhisatta, having been born as a Deva or Brahma, were to teach about the nature of old age and death and perform miracles, others would not believe him, thinking, &quot;This Deva
or Brahma, although he himself enjoys happiness, is constant and unchanging, comes and teaches us the doctrine of impermanence, suffering and not-self, what kind of teaching is this?&quot; They would not listen to him with
respect. They would simply think, &quot;Is there anything that Brahma cannot teach us? There is nothing that he cannot teach. And are there any miracles that he cannot perform? Indeed, he can perform all miracles. So his teaching
a doctrine or performing a miracle is not something wonderful.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">As is attested by many, the Bodhisatta was born of Queen Maya; when he reached maturity, he enjoyed sensual pleasures; when a son was born to him, he abandoned the son, renounced the
world, and became a recluse; after he had practiced severe austerities (dukkara-cariya), he eventually attained knowledge of the path and omniscience and became a Buddha. When, therefore, he began to teach the Dhamma, or to
make manifest the nature of impermanence, or to explain the three characteristics (anicca, dukkha, anatta&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote8"><span class="tm16">8</span></a><a id="footnote8back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm33">), all the people listened to his teaching with respect, thinking: &#8220;Even this noble man,
endowed with great power and wisdom and knowing all aspects of the Dhamma, cannot overcome old age, illness and death, what to speak of us?&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm32">Our Buddha, who teaches us to get rid of sufferings such as birth, old age, etc., truly understands the true nature of all things! Indeed, Nibbana, where there
is no suffering such as birth, old age, etc., is blissful!&quot; With this faith they follow the Buddha&#39;s teaching, applying reason to it, and come to understand that this individuality (atta-bhava), which is actually
the five aggregates of clinging (upadanakkhandha), is suffering (dukkha) and the source of suffering.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm32">They also perfectly discern the faults of craving and greed which give rise to this body, which is in reality the five aggregates of clinging. Having discerned
this, sentient beings experience fear and aversion toward craving, which is the truth of the origin of suffering (samudaya-sacca); and toward the five groups of clinging, which are the truth of suffering (dukkha-sacca) arising
through craving. When they do this, they are prepared to attain final Nibbana (anupada-parinibbana), the complete cessation of suffering. Therefore the Bodhisatta said, &quot;I have come to this human world and have been conceived
in the lotus-like womb of Queen Maya in order to show all sentient beings the suffering of birth, old age, and death in the cycle of existence.</span></em></p>

had asked, &quot;Siddhartha, why do you occupy this unconquered throne that belongs to me?&quot; The Bodhisatta replied, &quot;Who is the witness who can prove that the unconquered throne belongs to you?&quot; Mara spread
out his hands, saying, &quot;What is the use of looking for other witnesses, all my troops who are now before you are witnesses.&quot; At that moment, millions of his hordes appeared simultaneously, creating a noise like a
landslide, shouting, &quot;I am the witness, I am the witness.&quot; Then the Bodhisatta, holding back Mara&#39;s hordes, recited the following verse with the intention of presenting his witness.</span></p>

<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">At that very moment, the great earth shook violently. The sound emanating from the earth caused the entire expanse of the sky to resonate loudly, like thunder. The seven mountain ranges,
as well as the Himalayas, emitted a deep, continuous sound. The entire 10,000 world system shook. The entire cloudless sky rumbled frighteningly, as if rice grains were cracking loudly in a red-hot frying pan.</span></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">Mara, finding himself caught between earth and sky amidst the incessant noise and din, greatly frightened, without shelter or help, lowered his battle-standard and, abandoning his weapons
on the spot, fled in confusion, not even being able to look back at his elephant Girmekhalu. As Mara fled, his great armies disintegrated, scattering in confusion in all directions, like ashes blown away by a storm; at last
they returned to the world of Vasavatti.</span></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">At that moment, seeing Mara&#39;s great armies disintegrating, the Devas and Brahmas who had fled in fear at Mara&#39;s appearance and who were watching to see, &quot;Who will emerge victorious?
Who will be the vanquished?&quot; simultaneously proclaimed in deep praise the joyful news, &quot;Mara has been vanquished. Prince Siddhartha has emerged victorious. We will celebrate and honor his victory&quot; (jayo hi buddhassa
sirimato aya&#7745; - &quot;Truly, this is the victory of the blessed Buddha&quot;). This news was passed from one Naga to another Naga, from one Garuda to another Garuda, from one Deva to another Deva, from one Brahma to
another Brahma. Carrying incense and fragrant flowers in their hands, they gathered at the throne of Maha Bodhi, where the Bodhisatta resided.</span></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm16">Thus, with the victory over Mara Vasavatti before sunset on the full moon day of the month of Vesakha, in 528 B.C., the Bodhisatta became the conqueror of the entire world of living beings
and attained a secure, flawless, fearless state.</span></p>

<p class="tm25"><em><span class="tm31">Rejoicing at the throne of Bodhi, they proclaimed</span></em></p>

<p class="tm27"><br /></p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">In describing the path taken by the Bodhisatta during his journey and his activities on the full moon of the month of Vesakha in 528 BCE, the commentaries on the Chronicles of the Buddhas
(Buddha-va&#7745;sa), the Introduction to the Birth Histories (J&#257;taka-nid&#257;na) and the Ornaments of the Conqueror (Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra) generally agree in the substance of their narratives. They differ slightly
only in their presentation, some presenting things briefly and others in greater detail.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">However, in describing the Bodhisatta&#39;s midday rest in the Sala forest, the commentaries to the Chronicles of the Buddhas and the Introduction to the Jataka Birth Stories make no
mention of the attainment of jhanas (jh&#257;na-sam&#257;patti) and super-knowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;). On the other hand, the Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra states that the Bodhisatta attained the eight mundane jhanas
and the five mundane super-knowledges while spending the day in the Sala forest.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">It is also stated that by the time he arrived at the Maha Bodhi tree, the noble Bodhisatta already possessed physical strength (majjhima-purisa) and the power of super-knowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;).
This statement by the author of the Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra is consistent with his other statements, namely: &quot;When Mara advanced on him to fight, the noble Bodhisatta said: &#39;If I wish, I can cover the entire world
system with my body&#39;, and also: &#39;Pointing as evidence to the great benefits accomplished in his existence as Vessantara&#39;,&quot; which could only be known through knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm27">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm27"><em><span class="tm32">According to the author of the Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra, the Bodhisatta had already acquired the eight mundane jh&#257;nas and the five mundane superknowledges by the time he met the
leaders, Alara and Udaka. Without using them during the six years of ascetic practice (dukkara-cariy&#257;), they had become as if stained, like golden bowls that become dull without use; the Bodhisatta purified them anew
while in the Sala forest, as if polishing stained bowls. The implication is evidently that it was only after his victory over Mara that the Bodhisatta made full use of the knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;sa-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)
and divine vision (dibba-cakkhu-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;) he had already acquired to attain the stage of insight into truths. These observations are made here because the view of the author of the Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra
seems worthy of attention.</span></em></p>

<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">The Anguttara Nikaya (AN 3.80) explains the hierarchy of world systems:</span></p>
<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">1,000 worlds = small thousandth world system</span></p>
<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">1,000 small thousandth systems = average thousandth system (or millionth)</span></p>

<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">Thus, the ten-thousand world system includes one billion (1,000,000,000) individual worlds.</span></p>
<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">The suttas often mention that the light from important events (such as the appearance of the Buddha) illuminates the ten-thousand world system, symbolizing the scale
of the influence of the Dhamma.</span></p>

birth, devas are still in samsara and are subject to rebirth. According to the Buddha&#39;s teaching, being born as a human is even more favorable for achieving enlightenment than being born as a deva, since devas, living
in pleasure and comfort, often lack the motivation to practice the Dhamma.</span></p>

<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">In this story, the Bodhisatta was born as a hare and lived in the forest with other animals. One day, on a full moon day, he decided to observe uposatha (a day of
observing special vows) and practice giving. Shakra (the king of the devas) came to him in the form of a brahmin, asking for alms. Since the hare had nothing but grass, which the brahmin could not eat, the hare decided to
give the only thing he had - his own body. He jumped into a fire that the brahmin had made.</span></p>
<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">Shakra, touched by such self-sacrifice, revealed his true nature and in memory of this act placed an image of a hare on the moon (according to Asian tradition, the
silhouette of a hare is visible on the moon).</span></p>
<p class="tm8"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm34">This story illustrates the paramita of giving (dana-paramita) in its highest form &#8211; the willingness to give even one&#8217;s own life for the benefit of others.</span></p>
