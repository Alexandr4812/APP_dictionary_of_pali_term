<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">After the Bodhisatta had completed severe austerities (dukkara-cariy&#257;) for six years, about the first waxing moon of May (Ves&#257;kha) following the month of
April (Citta) in the year 528 B.C., the following thought occurred to him:<br /><br />&#8220;The ascetics (sama&#7751;a) and brahmins of the past, future, and present in their practice of asceticism could only go through this
degree of pain and hardship at best; they could not go through greater hardships than those I am now enduring. The hardships I have endured will not be less, and may even be greater, than the pain and suffering endured by
the ascetics and brahmins of the past, future, and present. I have striven diligently and practiced asceticism for six long years. Although I have striven so diligently in this way, I have not attained omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
and have not become a Buddha. Perhaps, there is another way of practice, another path to achieving omniscience and becoming a Buddha.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">Reflecting in this way, he realized that he had attained and entered into the first absorption through the breath (anapana-jhana) when, as a child, he sat in the
shade of a rose apple tree during the ploughing ceremony conducted by his father, Raja Suddhodana. He realized then that the practice of the first absorption through the breath must certainly be the true path, the correct
way of practice for attaining omniscience and becoming a Buddha. He further reflected, &quot;Why should I be afraid of the bliss of absorption attainable through meditation on the breath? It is a bliss that arises solely from
renunciation (nekkhamma) and is completely separated from desire for material objects and sense pleasures. I am certainly not afraid of the bliss of absorption from meditation on the breath.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">He then went on to reflect, &quot;Perhaps I will not be able to make the effort and develop the said breathing meditation with this body of mine which is so exhausted
and dried up. It will be good if I take some solid, coarse food, such as boiled rice, to invigorate and refresh this exhausted body before I try to achieve the said absorption through breathing meditation.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">Having thus considered, the Bodhisatta took up the begging bowl which he had put aside, went round the market town of Senagama for alms, and nourished his withered,
emaciated body with the food which he had obtained during his begging round. Within two or three days he had regained his strength, and the essential physical characteristics of a Great Man (Maha-purisa-lakkhana), which had
disappeared during the strenuous practice of ascetic endeavors, again appeared clearly in their original forms. At that time, the physical body of the Bodhisatta again appeared fresh, like the color of gold.</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">It is especially noteworthy here that when the Bodhisatta reflected on the right way for realizing omniscience, for becoming a Buddha, after giving up the practice
of ascetic exertion, he correctly judged that the eight worldly attainments of absorption which he had attained after meeting the teachers Alara and Udaka were only the basis for the cycle of suffering (vatta-padaka).<br />He
also judged that the breathing meditation which he had developed in the shade of the rose-apple tree while his father, Raja Suddhodana, was performing the ploughing ceremony was the right way for realizing omniscience and
for his becoming a Buddha, since breathing meditation was part of mindfulness of the body (kayagata-sati) and the basis of insight meditation (vipassana) for all Bodhisattas. See the subcommentary to the Collection of Middle
Discourses (Majjhima-nikaya).</span></em></p>

<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8"></span><strong><span class="tm15">The Group of Five Leaves the Bodhisatta</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">It is a natural law (dhammata) that when a Bodhisatta is ready to become a Buddha after completing his ascetic endeavors, either the ascetics accompanying him desert
him for one reason or another, or he himself leaves them behind. Therefore, when the Bodhisatta began to support his body by eating whatever coarse food he obtained while begging, the said Group of Five became disgusted with
him, grumbling, &quot;The ascetic Gotama has become one who practices for the sake of material gain. He has become one who has abandoned practice and returned to material attachments.&quot; Following the natural course of
events, they left the Bodhisatta and went to Isipatana, the Deer Grove near Varanasi, where all Buddhas teach the first sermon, the Wheel of Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">It is a natural rule for the attendants of ascetics to leave the Bodhisattvas who are ready to become Buddhas and go to the Deer Grove, where every Buddha will certainly
teach the First Sermon or the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhamma-cakka).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">The group of Five Ascetics left the Bodhisatta around the new moon of April (Citta) and went to Migadaya, the Deer Grove. When the accompanying ascetics left him,
the Bodhisatta, living a solitary life, had acquired a considerable degree of solitude, which contributed to extraordinary progress and the strengthening of his concentration. Thus, living in complete solitude for fifteen
days, practicing bhavana and progressing in it, the noble Bodhisatta saw five great dreams after midnight, approaching dawn on the fourteenth waxing day of the month of May (Vesakha) in the year 528 B.C.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8"></span><strong><span class="tm15">Five Great Dreams of the Bodhisattva.</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">1. He dreamed that he was sleeping, using the surface of the earth as a bed, the Himalayas as a pillow, placing his left hand on the eastern ocean, his right hand
on the western ocean, and both feet on the southern ocean.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">This first dream foreshadowed his realization of omniscience and becoming a Buddha among humans, Devas and Brahmas.</span></p>
<p class="tm23"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm23"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8"></span>
<img src="liveEn14_&#1092;&#1072;&#1081;&#1083;&#1099;/img00001.JPG" width="752" height="492" border="3" alt="" /></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">2. He dreamed that a kind of grass (tiriya) with a reddish stem the size<br />of a yoke grew out of his navel. As he watched, it grew first half a cubit, then a cubit,
a fathom, two fathoms, a mile, half a league, a league, and so on, rising higher and higher until it touched the sky, the cosmos, many thousands of leagues up, and remained there.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">This second dream foreshadowed that he would be able to teach the Eightfold Path (attangika-magga), which is the middle path (majjhima-patipada), to humans and devas.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span>
<img src="liveEn14_&#1092;&#1072;&#1081;&#1083;&#1099;/img00002.JPG" width="769" height="451" border="3" alt="" /></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">3. He dreamed that hordes of maggots with white bodies and black heads were slowly crawling up his legs, covering them from the tip of his toenail to his kneecap.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">This third dream foreshadowed that many black-headed people wearing pure white garments would take great shelter (maha-sarana-gamana) in him.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span>
<img src="liveEn14_&#1092;&#1072;&#1081;&#1083;&#1099;/img00003.JPG" width="774" height="493" border="3" alt="" /></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">4. He dreamed that four kinds of birds: blue, gold, red and gray in color, flew in from the four directions of the world, and when they rushed to prostrate themselves
at his feet, all four kinds of birds turned completely white.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">This fourth dream foretold that the representatives of the four varnas (catuvanna): khattiya (warriors and rulers), brahmin (priests and scholars), vessa (merchants
and farmers) and sudda (servants and workers), would accept the teaching of the Buddha, join the Sangha and attain the state of Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span>
<img src="liveEn14_&#1092;&#1072;&#1081;&#1083;&#1099;/img00004.JPG" width="768" height="499" border="3" alt="" /></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">5. He dreamed that he was walking back and forth across a large pile of excrement without getting dirty.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">This fifth dream foreshadowed the acquisition of four necessary things: clothing, food donations, shelter and medicine, and that he would use them without any attachment
or clinging to them.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>

<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm12"><span class="tm8"></span><strong><span class="tm15">Four reasons for dreams</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">Dreams occur for four reasons:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">1. Due to metabolic disorders, such as disorders of bile (pitta), one has terrible dreams, such as falling from a mountain, flying in the sky with a frightened heart,
being chased by wild animals such as wild elephants, horses, lions, leopards, tigers, etc., or by evil people.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">2. Because of past experience, a person sees in dreams, hears and uses objects that he has previously seen, heard or used.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">3. Various illusory objects are manifested by the devas in a person&#39;s dream - good visions if they want to do good, or bad visions if they want to do harm. A
person sees all these objects due to the supernatural powers of the devas.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">4. When a person sees a prophetic dream, he sees pleasant or unpleasant visions that foretell future events because of his past good or bad deeds (kamma). Such dreams
are like the dream of Maha Maya Devi, which foretells the conception of the Bodhisattva, or the dream of the King of Kosala, which foretells sixteen great events, or the five great dreams of the Bodhisattva.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">Of the four kinds of dreams, those that arise from metabolic disturbances and past experiences are usually false. As for dreams caused by the deception of the devas,
they may be true or false dreams. Angry devas tend to show visions in dreams as a trick to cause destruction, as in the story below. Dreams that foretell future events are invariably true.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">False visions in dreams:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">At the Naga monastery in the Rohana area of Sri Lanka, the abbot ordered a large iron tree to be cut down without informing the Sangha. The deva of the tree (rukkha-deva)
who resided in the iron tree sent dreams to the abbot to deceive him into believing them. Having gained the monk&#39;s confidence, the deva told him in a dream, &quot;On the seventh day from today, venerable sir, your worldly
benefactor, the king, will die.&quot; The abbot, believing these words, informed the female attendants of the palace accordingly. After this, they all wept loudly together. When the king inquired of them, they told him of
the abbot&#39;s words. When the king counted the days, seven days passed, and the king, who was still alive, ordered the limbs of the abbot to be cut off for causing panic by spreading false information.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">These four types of dreams are experienced only by ordinary people (puthujjana), as well as by Stream-Enters (Sot&#257;panna), Once-Returners (Sakad&#257;g&#257;mi),
and Non-Returners (An&#257;g&#257;mi), because they have not freed themselves from distorted perception (vipall&#257;sa). Arahants (arahant), who have abandoned distorted perception, do not see such dreams.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">This distortion manifests itself in three forms:</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">1. Distortion of perception (sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-vipall&#257;sa)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">2. Distortion of thinking (citta-vipall&#257;sa)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">3. Distortion of views (di&#7789;&#7789;hi-vipall&#257;sa)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">Each of these forms includes four types of delusions:</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">- taking the impermanent for the permanent</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">- taking the unclean for the pure</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">- accepting suffering as happiness</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">- taking the impersonal for having a self</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><em><span class="tm19">Arahants who have completely eliminated all these distortions of perception of reality do not see such dreams.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">According to the commentary to the Great Dream Sutta (Mah&#257;-supina-sutta, AN 5.196), with regard to the timing of dreams, those dreamed during the daytime, the
first watch, the middle watch, and the last watch of the night are usually not true, whereas dreams at dawn, when the food eaten has been digested and the nutrients absorbed by the body, are usually true. A dream that carries
auspicious omens usually brings good fortune, whereas a dream with bad omens usually brings misfortune.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">The above-mentioned five great dreams are not dreamed by ordinary people (puthujjana), kings, Universal Monarchs (Cakkavatti), chief disciples (aggas&#257;vaka),
Paccekabuddhas, or fully enlightened Buddhas (Samm&#257;sambuddha). Only bodhisattvas have such dreams. Our bodhisattva saw these five great dreams after midnight, just before dawn, on the 14th day of the waxing moon in the
month of Ves&#257;kha in the year 528 B.C.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">The Bodhisatta, having awakened from sleep and sat up in a cross-legged posture, after having seen the five great dreams, thought to himself: &quot;If I had seen
these five great dreams when I was living in the royal city of Kapilavatthu, I could have told them to my father, Rajah Suddhodana. I could have told them to my mother also, if she were alive. But now, in the forest of Uruvela,
there is no one who can listen to the five great dreams and interpret them for me. I myself will read these omens.&quot; And then he himself interpreted the dreams thus: &quot;This first dream foretells the attainment of such-and-such
a good; this second dream, such-and-such a good,&quot; and so on, as has been said above.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm8"></span><span class="tm18">After he had seen the five great dreams and interpreted their meaning himself, the Bodhisatta concluded: &quot;Truly, I will certainly become a Buddha this very day.&quot;</span></p>
