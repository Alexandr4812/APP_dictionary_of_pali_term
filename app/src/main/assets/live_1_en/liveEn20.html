<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm12">Buddha reflects on the Dhamma</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then, on Thursday, the sixth day of the waxing moon in the month of Asalha, 50 days after he became Buddha on Wednesday, the full moon of the month of Vesak, having
spent 49 days (satta-satt&#257;ha), the Buddha rose from his seat under the Rajayatana tree and again went to the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, where he remained sitting in a cross-legged posture.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After this, the Buddha, in solitary tranquility, reflected thus: &#8220;This aggregate of Dhamma, the Four Noble Truths, clearly comprehended by me through self-cognized
knowledge (sayambh&#363;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), is truly profound, like the body of water that supports the earth&#8217;s firmament. Truly, it is difficult to see, like a mustard seed hidden by the great mountain Meru. Truly,
it is difficult to know, just as difficult as for the tip of one hair, divided into 100 strands, to touch the tip of another such divided hair. Truly, it is peaceful, truly noble. These two definitions refer to the supramundane
Dhamma (Lokutara-Dhamma). It is not a Dhamma into which intellectuals can delve through mere applied reasoning (vitakka). It is a Dhamma to be resorted to and accepted through knowledge and wisdom. (&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)
It is truly subtle, it is the Dhamma that is understood only by the wise who practice correctly.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">All these living beings, however, take pleasure in two forms of attachment, namely, attachment to the five objects of sense pleasure (k&#257;m&#257;laya) and attachment
to the enjoyment of the five sense objects (ta&#7751;h&#257;laya). These living beings who take pleasure in these two forms of attachment are not actually able to recognize this doctrine of dependent origination (pa&#7789;icca-samupp&#257;da),
the relationship of cause and effect. It will be even more difficult for them to realize Nibbana, which is the extinction of all the sankharas of conditioned phenomena (sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra), the complete rejection of all the
substrata of sensuality (k&#257;ma-upadhi), aggregates (khandha-upadhi), defilements (kilesa-upadhi) and formations (abhisa&#7749;kh&#257;ra-upadhi), which is the drying up of the 108 kinds of craving (ta&#7751;h&#257;); which
is the exhaustion of the 1500 forms of defilements and passions (kilesa-r&#257;ga), and which is the cessation of all suffering. Also, if I were to teach the Dhamma of such depth, those devas and persons whose faculties (indriya)
are immature, who are not yet fully developed for liberation, will not see or understand the Dhamma. Teaching the Dhamma to such devas and persons would only mean a waste of energy for me.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Moreover, two extremely wonderful verses, which had never been heard before, clearly appeared in the Buddha&#39;s stream of consciousness. (Ariyapariesana Sutta:
The Noble Search MN 26):</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><em><span class="tm23">Kicchena me adhigata&#7745;, hala&#7745; d&#257;ni pak&#257;situ&#7745;,<br /></span></em></strong><em><span
 class="tm13">What I have achieved with such difficulty, there is no point in proclaiming now.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><em><span class="tm23">r&#257;ga-dosa-paretehi, n&#257;ya&#7745; Dhammo susambudho.</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">This Dhamma will not be easily understood by those who are overcome by passion and hatred.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><em><span class="tm23">Pa&#7789;isotag&#257;mi&#7745; nipu&#7751;a&#7745;, gambh&#299;ra&#7745; duddasa&#7745; a&#7751;u&#7745;,</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">Going against the current of the World, the Dhamma, subtle, deep, difficult to see,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><em><span class="tm23">r&#257;ga-ratt&#257; na dakkhanti, tamokhandhena &#257;vu&#7789;&#257;.</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">Those who are overcome by passion, shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, will not see.<br /></span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">This thought is, in fact, the natural law (Dhammata) that arises in all Buddhas. The Buddha, thinking in this way, was inclined not to make efforts to teach the Dhamma
immediately for three reasons:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">1) The minds of living beings were full of defilements;<br />2) The Dhamma was very deep and subtle to understand;<br />3) The Buddha treated the Dhamma with the
greatest respect.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The Buddha&#39;s process of reflection can be compared to the thoughts of a doctor who, while treating a patient suffering from various diseases, reflects: &quot;In
what way and with what medicine should I treat this patient so that he will recover?&quot; In the same way, the Buddha, realizing on the one hand that all living beings are afflicted with various ailments of defilements (kilesa),
and on the other hand that the Dhamma is incredibly profound and difficult to understand, reflected: &quot;What Dhamma should be taught to these beings and what method should be used to teach them.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Another explanation is that there are two reasons (nid&#257;na) for the Buddhas to teach the Dhamma:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">1) The feeling of compassion for living beings that arises in the mind-stream of the Buddhas, that is, great compassion (mah&#257;-karu&#7751;&#257;), which is the
internal (ajjhattika) cause;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">2) The act of requesting the World-Honored Brahma for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma, that is, the request of Brahma (Brahma-y&#257;cana), which is the external (b&#257;hira)
cause.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">At the time when the Buddha was thus reflecting on the depth of the Dhamma and the abundance of defilements (kilesa) in sentient beings, the Buddha&#39;s great compassion
(mah&#257;-karu&#7751;&#257;), the inner cause, was already there, but the outer cause was still missing, since Brahma had not yet made his request. The Buddha was inclined to teach the Dhamma only after Brahma had made his
request, thereby fulfilling the outer cause.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Teaching the Dhamma only after Brahma&#39;s request was the natural law (Dhammata) for every Buddha. The reason why the teaching was given only after such a request
from Brahma was as follows:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Outside the Buddha&#39;s teaching, before the Buddha appeared, those who were considered virtuous - whether laymen, wanderers, ascetics or Brahmins - worshipped and
revered Brahma alone. If the Great Brahma, respected by the world, showed reverence to the Buddha by bowing before him, the entire world (including the infinite inhabitants of the divine realms) would follow his example and
develop (saddha) faith in the Buddha. For this reason, it was customary for the Buddhas to teach the Dhamma only after Brahma&#39;s request. Thus, only when the external cause - Brahma&#39;s request - was fulfilled would the
Buddha begin to teach the Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm12">The Request of the Great Brahma Sahampati</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">The great Brahma Sahampati was in a previous birth a noble elder named Sahaka during the time of Buddha Kassapa. In this capacity he attained the first jhana,
and when he died without losing this absorption, he was reborn in the first plane of jhana existence and became Mahabrahma with a lifespan of 64 intermediate periods, which is equal to one incalculable kalpa. The Brahmas of
the said plane of existence called him Brahma Sahampati.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">When the Buddha&#39;s mind-stream was such that he was still inclined not to make efforts to teach the Dhamma, this thought occurred to Brahma Sahampati:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm12">vata bho loko! Vinassati vata bho loko!</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">&quot;Friends, the world will perish! O friends, the world will perish!&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">For the Buddha, who is worthy of special veneration by Devas and people because of his complete and true penetration into the knowledge of all things in the world,
is inclined not to make efforts to teach the Dhamma!</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then, as instantly as a person of great physical strength might straighten a bent arm or bend a straightened arm, Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the world of the
Brahmas along with his 10,000 Mahabrahmas and appeared before the Buddha.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">At that time, Brahma Sahampati, with his robe over his left shoulder and his right knee on the ground, sitting as befits a Brahma, paid homage to the Buddha with
his palms folded and addressed him:<br /><br />&quot;O Bhagavan! May the Buddha be pleased to teach the Dhamma to all living beings - humans, Devas and Brahmas. Exalted One of Mercy, may the Buddha be pleased to teach the
Dhamma to all living beings - humans, Devas and Brahmas. There are many beings who have only a little dust of defilements in their eyes. If these beings do not have the opportunity to hear the Dhamma of the Buddha, they will
suffer great loss, not having attained the extraordinary Dhamma of the paths and fruits that they deserve. Venerable Buddha, there will be those who can comprehend the Dhamma taught by you.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then, addressing the Buddha in prose, Brahma Sahampati also made a request in verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">&quot;Exalted Buddha, in the past, before your appearance, in the country of Magadha there existed an impure, false teaching, supported by six heretical teachers
such as Purana Kassapa, who were tainted with the filth of defilements (kilesa).&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">Please open the great gate to the deathless Nibbana, which has remained closed since the disappearance of the teaching of Buddha Kassapa. May all sentient beings
hear the Dhamma of the four noble truths, realized by you, free from the dust of defilements.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">&quot;Noble and wise Buddha, possessor of the vision of wisdom, able to see in all directions! Just as a man with keen eyesight, standing on the top of a rocky
hill, surveys all the people around him, so you, venerable sir, already freed from sorrows, look upon all living beings - humans, Devas and Brahmas - who have fallen into the abyss of suffering and are oppressed by birth,
old age, illness, death and so on.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">That Brahma came and made a request to teach the Dhamma at a time when the Buddha was reflecting on the depth of the Dhamma and the abundance of defilements in
sentient beings, and was still inclined not to make efforts to teach the Dhamma is the natural law (Dhammata) for every Buddha.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">Buddha surveys the world</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">When Brahma Sahampati thus asked to survey the world and teach the Dhamma, the two conditions for this - the external cause and the internal cause - were fulfilled;
and so he surveyed the world of living beings with the eyes of the Buddha (Buddha-cakkhu): Knowledge of the hidden desires or inclinations of beings (&#257;say&#257;nusaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) and knowledge of the maturity
or immaturity of faculties (indriya-paro-pariyatta-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote1"><span class="tm13">1</span></a><a
 id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm27">).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Looking in this way, he clearly saw different types of beings, comparable to the four kinds of lotuses: there are blue lotuses, red lotuses, or white lotuses in a
pond. Of these four kinds of lotuses, there are:<br /><br />1) the kind of lotuses that arise in water, grow and develop in water, but remain submerged;<br />2) the kind of lotuses that arise in water, grow in water, and stand
level with the surface of the water;<br />3) the kind of lotuses that arise in water, grow in water, and stand elevated above the water, without the water wetting them or sticking to them.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">Of the three kinds of lotuses mentioned, the 3rd lotus, which stands raised above the water, will bloom on the same day; the 2nd lotus, which stands level with
the surface of the water, will bloom on the next day; and the 1st lotus, which develops but remains submerged, will bloom on the third day.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Besides the three kinds of lotus, there is a fourth kind of lotus that will not emerge from the water or bloom at all; this kind of lotus is diseased and will eventually
become food for fish and turtles. Like these four kinds of lotus, there are:</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">1. Creatures that have little or no dust pollution.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">2. Creatures that have a lot of impurities.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">3. Beings who have the five faculties - faith (saddh&#257;), energy (viriya), mindfulness (sati), concentration (sam&#257;dhi) and wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)
- are sharp and mature.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">4. Creatures who have these five abilities are dull and immature.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">5. Beings whose dispositions, such as faith, energy, etc., are good or bad.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">6. Beings who will easily understand the Dhamma, and beings who will not.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">7. Beings who regard all worldly phenomena (such as the aggregates, all forms of defilements, unwholesome actions, volitional impulses, and actions that give rise
to further existences) as a terrible group of dangers, like an enemy brandishing a sharp sword, ready to attack.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">8. And beings that do not have such a vision. Or have a distorted opposite vision.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">When the Buddha surveyed the world of beings with his Buddha eye, he saw four groups of individuals:</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">1) Individuals who understood the Dhamma of the Four Noble Truths even in its brief exposition (m&#257;tik&#257;-uddesa) and grew like lotuses rising above the
water that bloom on the same day as the sunrise (uggh&#257;&#7789;ita&ntilde;&ntilde;&#363;-puggala);</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">2) Individuals who could not blossom simply by hearing a summary of the Dhamma, but understood and blossomed only when the Four Noble Truths were taught and explained
in detail (vitth&#257;ra-niddesa-pada-bh&#257;jan&#299;), like lotuses at the surface of the water that blossom the next day (vipa&ntilde;cita&ntilde;&ntilde;&#363;-puggala);</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">3) Individuals who could not blossom by hearing the Dhamma briefly or in detail at one time, but understood the Four Noble Truths and blossomed after a day, a
month, or a year with the help of friends and by persistently making efforts to understand the Dhamma, like absorbed lotuses that blossom on the third day (neyya-puggala);</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">4) Individuals who do not realize the path and fruit, no matter how much they hear and practice the Dhamma in this life (pada-parama-puggala), although they try
very hard, they gain the benefit of the predisposition (v&#257;san&#257;) for the Dhamma in future existences in which they can blossom. They end their lives becoming food for the fish and turtles of defilements, like diseased
lotuses that do not rise from the water and do not blossom, but end up becoming food for the fish and turtles.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm25">Having seen these four types of individuals and thinking about the Dhamma that would benefit them, the Buddha developed the effort to teach the Dhamma. He then
divided all beings into two categories: individuals fit for the highest truths and liberation, called capable people (bhabba-puggala), and individuals unfit for the highest truths and liberation, called incapable people (abhabba-puggala).
Of these two categories, the incapable people were put aside and not considered, he took only the capable people into the field of his omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) and divided them into
six groups, saying: &#8220;Beings full of passion (r&#257;ga), so many. Beings full of hatred (dosa), so many. Beings full of delusion (moha), so many. Beings of thought (vitakka), so many. Beings full of faith (saddh&#257;),
so many. Beings full of wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;), so many.&#8221; And then he expressed his intention, saying: &#8220;Indeed, I will teach the Dhamma!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">After deep reflection, the Buddha gave his consent to Brahma Sahampati in verse (MN 26):</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><em><span class="tm16">Ap&#257;rut&#257; tesa&#7745; amatassa dv&#257;r&#257;,</span></em></strong></p>

<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">The gates that lead to Immortality are open,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Let those who can hear be filled with faith.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">I abstained from teaching before,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">O Brahma, this is the highest Dhamma among men.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">What is meant here is that only those who have the proper skill of listening will be able to listen to the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. And only if they have
faith in him will they make efforts to practice the Dhamma with faith, and only then will the gate of Nibbana be opened. If they do not have faith in the Buddha, even if they have good skill of listening, they will not have
sufficient faith in the Dhamma either, will not make sufficient efforts to practice it, and in that case the gate of Nibbana will remain closed. Therefore, beings who have good hearing (suvaco) should have faith in the Buddha
and listen to the Dhamma.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">It may also be said that from the time of the disappearance (S&#257;sana - era) of Kassapa Buddha until the present time, the true Buddha and his true Dhamma
could not be found, and therefore in the consciousness-stream of beings there was no true faith - that faith which is a jewel to be kept tightly clenched in the fist. Devotion to heretical teachers at that time was not true
faith. It was only the arising of an unwholesome consciousness (akusala-cittupp&#257;da) mistaking the false for the true (micch&#257;dhimokkha). Now that the true Buddha has appeared, let the devas and men with good ears
unclench their fists and take out the precious bundles of faith which have been clenched in their fists, as it were, since the disappearance (S&#257;sana) of Kassapa Buddha.</span></em><span
 class="tm27">&nbsp;Then Brahma Sahampati became filled with joy and exclaimed:<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">&quot;The Buddha has given me his word of consent to proclaim the Dhamma!&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then, having bowed to the Buddha and walked around Him on the right side, he disappeared from that very place and reappeared in the world of Brahma.</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"><br /><br /></span><strong><span class="tm18">Buddha goes to Deer Park</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">After Brahma Sahampatti had passed away, the Buddha reflected:</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&quot;To whom shall I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly comprehend the Dhamma taught by me?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then it occurred to Him:</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8220;The chief of the ascetics, Alara of the Kalama clan, is one who is endowed with the three kinds of wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;):</span></p>
<p class="tm35"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><span class="tm27">1. wisdom about the birth of beings (j&#257;ti-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)<br />2. wisdom about meditation (bh&#257;van&#257;-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)<br />3.
wisdom about preservation (p&#257;rih&#257;rika-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><span class="tm27">He is also a person whose wisdom eye (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-cakkhu) has long been free from the dust of defilements&#8212;apparajakkha-puggala. It would
be good if I taught the Dhamma to him first. He will quickly understand the Teaching.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">At that moment, one of the devas, without making himself visible, addressed the Buddha:</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">&#8220;O Bhagavan, it is now seven days since Alara of the Kalama clan died.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">However, the Buddha, not accepting the deva&#39;s words without confirmation, with the help of omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
himself saw and verified that Alara had indeed died seven days ago, and had been reborn in the realm of nothingness (&#257;ki&ntilde;ca&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yatana), the third of the four immaterial levels of existence (ar&#363;pa-loka).</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">After reflecting: &#8220;Indeed, it was a great loss for Alara of the Kalama clan that he missed the opportunity to attain the path and fruit of which he was worthy;
if he had been able to hear the Dhamma taught by me, he would quickly have realized the Four Noble Truths,&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><span class="tm27">The Buddha again continued to think: &#8220;To whom shall I now teach the Dhamma? Who will be able to understand it quickly?&#8221; Then he thought: &#8220;The
teacher of the ascetics Udakka, the son of Rama, is also endowed, like Alara, with the three kinds of wisdom. He is also one who has little dust in his eyes; his eye of wisdom has long been free from the dust of defilements.
It would be good if I taught the Dhamma to him first &#8211; he will quickly understand the Teaching.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">At that moment another deva, without revealing himself, addressed the Buddha:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">&nbsp;&quot;The Venerable Buddha, Teacher Udakka, son of Rama, passed away yesterday around midnight.&quot;<br /></span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">However, the Buddha, not relying solely on the word of the deva, verified this by means of his omniscience and confirmed that Udakka had indeed died the previous
night at midnight and that he had since been reborn in the Realm of Neither-Perception-Non-Perception (Nevasa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-n&#257;sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yatana), the fourth of the four immaterial realms (ar&#363;pa-loka),
also called Bhavagga.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">And then, thinking: &quot;Indeed, great was the loss of the ascetic teacher Uddaka, the son of Rama, that he missed the opportunity to attain the paths and fruits
of which he was worthy. If he could have heard the Dhamma taught by me, he would quickly have realized the Four Noble Truths.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">He again continued to reflect: &#8220;To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand it?&#8221; Then the Buddha thought: &#8220;The group of
five wandering ascetics (pa&ntilde;ca-vaggiya) have been of great help to me. They stayed with me and looked after me when I was practising arduous austerities (dukkara-cariy&#257;) for six years in the Uruvela forest. Therefore,
it would be good if I first taught the Dhamma to this group of five.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Thinking, &#8220;Where are these five ascetics now living?&#8221; he saw them, through the super-knowledge of divine vision (dibba-cakkhu-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;),
living in the great Deer Park, also called Isipatana, near the city of Varanasi.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><span class="tm27">Thinking, &#8220;I will go to the Deer Park and recite the Dhamma-cakka,&#8221; he performed his alms rounds near the Bodhima&#7751;&#7693;ala and remained
there until the fourteenth day of the waxing moon in the month of &#256;s&#257;&#7735;ha. Then, on the full moon day of that month, early in the morning, having collected and taken with him his robes and alms bowl, he thought,
&#8220;I will go to the city of Varanasi,&#8221; and began a journey of eighteen yojanas on foot.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">The distance between Mah&#257; Bodhi and Gaya (Buddhagaya) was three miles. The distance between Mah&#257; Bodhi and Varanasi was eighteen yojanas. The Buddhas
of the past went to the Deer Park to preach the Wheel of Dhamma, by means of their meditative absorptions (jh&#257;na). As for our Buddha, he walked these eighteen yojanas, for he foresaw that a hermit named Upaka would soon
attain the state of non-returner (An&#257;g&#257;mi) due to his previous merits.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">He knew the following: &#8220;Upaka is now walking along the same road. He will meet me, converse with me, and continue on his way. Later, tired of the World,
he will return to me to listen to the Dhamma and become a noble non-returner (An&#257;g&#257;mi) in this life, and then attain the state of Arhat in his next life, being reborn in Avih&#257;, the twelfth realm of the Brahm&#257;
world.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">Buddha meets the hermit Upaka</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">When the Buddha was walking from Mah&#257; Bodhi towards Varanasi, a hermit named Upaka, who was travelling between Mah&#257; Bodhi and Varanasi, approached him.
Seeing the Buddha, he asked:</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">- Friend, your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind are clear and pure. The color of your face is bright and clear. Friend, to whom have you gone as a hermit?

<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">And then the Blessed One answered him in verse:</span></p>

<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">To this the hermit Upaka said:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">&#8212; Friend, if all this is so, then you must be possessed of infinite knowledge (ananta-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) and have conquered Mara in his five forms.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">The Blessed One replied:</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">M&#257;dis&#257; ve Jin&#257; honti, ye patt&#257; &#257;savakkhaya&#7745;,</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Such are called Jina, who have achieved the destruction of the Asavas.</span></em></p>

<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">I have conquered the unwholesome dhammas, therefore, Upaka, I am Jina.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then the hermit Upaka said:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">&quot;Friend, perhaps everything you say is true!&quot;<br /></span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">nodded his head and went another way - to the Va&#7749;kah&#257;ra region.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">The opportunity to converse and exchange words with the Buddha became for him an auspicious cause (upanissaya) for his subsequent renunciation of worldly life.<br />Yes,
indeed! Upaka had a special merit (adhik&#257;ra) different from the ordinary.<br /><br />It was for this reason that the Buddha walked all the way to meet him.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">Those who heard the Dhamma from the Buddha before he proclaimed the Discourse of the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhamma-cakka) could not yet attain the paths and fruits
(magga-phala). They only developed the inclination (v&#257;san&#257;) for subsequent penetration into the Dhamma.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">This is the natural law (dhammat&#257;).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm26">And so Upaka, although he listened to such an exalted Dhamma, revealing the qualities of the Buddha, did not attain either the path or the fruit. He merely acquired
a wholesome disposition (kusala-v&#257;san&#257;), which led him in the future to take monastic v&#257;san&#257; and further attainments.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">A Brief History of Upaka</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm36">Jumping ahead a little, we will tell the story of the ascetic Upaka.<br /><br /></span></em><span
 class="tm27">An ascetic named Upaka lived in a small hut in a hunter&#39;s village in the Va&#7749;kah&#257;ra region. He was highly respected and was under the care of the chief hunter of that village. Since there were many
mosquitoes in that area, Upaka spent his time inside a large clay vessel-like room. When the hunter was about to leave for a remote deer forest, he gave his daughter named Chapa this instruction:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&#8220;Daughter, take care of and diligently serve our venerable ascetic, who is an arahant. Do not neglect this!&#8221;<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Having said this, he went into the forest, accompanied by his sons and younger brothers.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Chapa, the daughter of the chief hunter, was of a pleasant appearance, with beautiful features. The day after his father&#39;s departure, the ascetic Upaka came to
the house of the chief hunter. When Chapa came to serve him the food she had prepared herself, he, seeing her up close, was overcome with passion. Therefore, even without being able to eat, he returned to his home, carrying
the food in a vessel.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Having placed the vessel with food in a suitable place, he lay down without touching the food, thinking:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;I can only live if I live with Chapa! If not, I will die!&#8221;<br /><br />On the seventh day, when the chief hunter returned home, he asked
Chapa about the ascetic Upaka.<br /><br />When Chapa answered:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;- &#8220;Father, your ascetic Upaka came to the house only once and never showed up again,&#8221;<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">The hunter, without even changing his clothes, in the same clothes he had on from the forest, immediately went to the ascetic Upaka. Approaching him, he began to
feel and knead his legs, asking:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, venerable sir?&#8221;<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Ascetic Upaka, without answering, continued to lie, rolling from side to side, and groaning. When the hunter began to persistently ask:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &quot;Tell me, venerable sir. I will do everything I can.&quot;<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Ascetic Upaka replied:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;If there is no way to live next to your daughter Chapa, then it is better for me to die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">When the hunter asked:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;Venerable sir, do you have any skill?&#8221;<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Ascetic Upaka replied:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then the hunter noticed:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;- &quot;Venerable sir, if a person is not knowledgeable in anything, he will not be able to manage household affairs.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Ascetic Upaka answered again:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;- &quot;I know nothing. However, I will be able to carry the carcasses of the animals you hunt. I will also be able to sell the meat.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">The hunter said:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&nbsp;- &quot;We also like the idea of you carrying and selling meat.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">He then gave him an upper garment and dressed him in worldly attire. Taking him home, he gave his daughter Chapa to him in marriage. From their marriage a son was
born, who was named Subbhuda. When the child began to cry, Chapa would rebuke and mock Upaka, singing a lullaby to hurt and humiliate him:</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">The son of a meat merchant, a former monk and ascetic!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">You are the son of a fool,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">a hanger-on in our house who fell in love with me!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Mom is trying to persuade you to fall asleep - don&#39;t cry!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">I wish you sleep.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">In a cradle decorated with emeralds,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Sleep, my son, as if made of pure gold.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Mom will sing and rock you to sleep.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Stop crying!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">I wish you sleep.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Your father is the last in a line of men!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Avoid his path;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">in the future strive for liberation (vimutti).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">Mom is instructing you,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm17">my beautiful son, my wreath of gold!</span></em></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then Upaka said:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">- Wife, do you really think that I have nowhere to go? I have a very good friend named Ananta Jina. I will go to this good friend.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Chapa, realizing:<br /><br />&#8220;This Upaka suffers unbearably from my ridicule and humiliation,&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Still, she continued to sing her lullaby over and over again.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">One day Upaka went to the Middle Land (Majjhima-desa) without saying anything to Chapa. At that time the Blessed One was staying at Jetavana Monastery in Savatthi;
and he had previously said to the monks:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8212; Monks, if anyone comes and asks about Ananta Jina, point me out to him.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Upaka asked everyone he met along the way:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8212; Where does Ananta Jina reside?</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">And in due course he reached Savatthi and, standing in the centre of Jetavana Monastery, asked the monks:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8212; Honorable sirs! Where is Ananta Jina?</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">The monks brought him to the Blessed One. Upon seeing the Buddha, Upaka immediately addressed him:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8212; Venerable Buddha! Do you remember and recognize me, your disciple?</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">When Buddha said:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">- Yes, Upaka, I remember. Where do you live now?</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Upaka replied:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">&#8212; Venerable sir! I live in Va&#7749;kah&#257;ra.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then Buddha asked him:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">- Upaka, you are already at an advanced age. Will you be able to join the order of hermits?</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Upaka replied:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">- Yes, Venerable One, I can.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Then the Buddha permitted him to take the highest initiation and instructed him in the proper way of meditation. Upaka practised this meditation with great diligence
and attained the fruition of the Non-Returner (An&#257;g&#257;m&#299;-phala). After his death he was reborn in the Brahma-loka, in the abode of Aviha, which is the lowest of the five realms of the world of Pure Abodes (Suddh&#257;v&#257;sa);
and soon after that he attained the state of an arhat.</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm31"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">After Upaka left C&#257;pa, she lost interest in the world. So, leaving her young son Subhadda in the care of his grandfather, she set out on the same path as Upaka.
Arriving at Savatthi, she took ordination in the presence of other nuns. There she practised diligently and developed insight, and, having traversed the four paths in succession, she attained arahantship and became known as
the Venerable C&#257;pa (Bhikkhun&#299; C&#257;p&#257;), the destroyer of defilements.</span></p>

 class="tm38">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the unique knowledge of Buddha, which allows him to:</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm38">- To determine the level of development of the 5 spiritual faculties (pa&ntilde;cindriya) in beings: saddh&#257; (faith), viriya (diligence), sati (mindfulness),
sam&#257;dhi (concentration), pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; (wisdom).</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm38">To see how developed or undeveloped these abilities are. To understand whether a person is ready to perceive a certain level of teaching. To select the most suitable
