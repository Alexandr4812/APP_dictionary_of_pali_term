<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After the Bodhisatta became the Buddha, on the first day of the waning moon of the month of Vesak, the Buddha uttered the sublime saying (ud&#257;na), and, sitting
cross-legged on the unconquered (apar&#257;jita) throne, he reflected thus:<br />&#8220;In order to attain this unconquered throne, I have passed from one birth to another for four incalculable periods and 100,000 kalpas,
repeatedly fulfilling the ten perfections&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote1"><span class="tm15">1</span></a><a id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm15">&nbsp;in a unique way.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Over the course of four incalculable periods and 100,000 kalpas, in order to obtain this unconquered throne, I have many times lost my adorned head; many times taken
out and given away my eyes and heart; many times given away my son like J&#257;li, my daughter like Ka&#7751;h&#257;jin&#257;, and my wife like Madd&#299; to those who asked for them as slaves. This is the throne on which
I completely defeated Mara&#39;s fivefold army. It is also an extremely auspicious and glorious place. By remaining on this throne, all my wishes, including the wish to become a Buddha, have been fulfilled. I will remain for
now in this place to which I owe so much.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Thus the Buddha spent seven days on the invincible throne, remaining in the fourth jhana.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Remaining thus in absorption throughout the first day of the waning moon of the month of Vesak, the Buddha enjoyed the bliss of liberation (vimutti) or Awakening.
During the first watch of the night of the first day, he contemplated dependent origination (pa&#7789;icca-samupp&#257;da) thus: Avijj&#257;-paccay&#257; sa&#7749;kh&#257;r&#257;, (from ignorance (avijj&#257;) arise three
kinds of volitional impulses (sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra), namely, wholesome volitional impulses (pu&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;bhisa&#7749;kh&#257;ra), unwholesome volitional impulses (apu&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;bhisa&#7749;kh&#257;ra),
and unwavering volitional impulses (&#257;ne&ntilde;j&#257;bhisa&#7749;kh&#257;ra))</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Having begun in this way, the Buddha continued to contemplate in the forward order the process by which the cycle of suffering arises. Then he contemplated: Avijj&#257;ya
tveva asesa-vir&#257;ga-nirodho sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra-nirodho, &quot;because of the complete cessation of ignorance through non-arising by means of the path of Awakening, the three kinds of volitional impulses, wholesome, unwholesome,
and unshakable, cease through non-arising.&quot; Having begun in this way, the Buddha continued to contemplate in the reverse order the process by which the cycle of suffering ceases.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">It is especially noteworthy here that although the Buddha clearly understood all the doctrines, he contemplated only the doctrine of dependent origination in
both the forward and reverse order, because when he began the practice of insight (vipassan&#257;) he began precisely by reflecting on this doctrine, and also because this doctrine is very subtle, profound and difficult to
comprehend.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">As the Buddha repeatedly reflected on this Doctrine both in the forward and backward order, he understood more and more clearly the process of the arising of suffering
in Samsara in the forward order: how on the basis of causes such as ignorance, volitional impulses arise, and so on. Similarly, the Buddha also understood the process of the cessation of suffering in the backward order: how
on account of the cessation of ignorance, and so on, volitional impulses cease, and so on. This resulted in the continuous arising in the Buddha of a series of such mental impulses (javana) that were spontaneous and connected
with knowledge and happiness (somanassa-sahagata-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-sampayutta-asa&#7749;kh&#257;rika-javana), preceded by joy (p&#299;ti).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Just as when a vessel is filled to the brim with ghee, the excess overflows, so when the vessel of the Buddha&#39;s mind was filled with the oil of rapture, preceded
by ever clearer knowledge of the Dhamma, the Buddha uttered the sublime saying (Ud. 1.1), as if it had overflowed his heart:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Yad&#257; have p&#257;tu-bhavanti dhamm&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&#257;t&#257;pino jh&#257;yato br&#257;hma&#7751;assa;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">athassa ka&#7749;kh&#257; vapayanti sabb&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">yato paj&#257;n&#257;ti sahetu-dhamma&#7745;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When the 37 factors of Awakening (Bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma) are clearly manifested in the stream of consciousness of the Arhat, who:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">1. freed from all evil</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">2. endowed with the right force to burn 1500 impurities</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">3. whose meditation is so steady and sharp that it reaches the path of absorption (appan&#257;-jh&#257;na)</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">through contemplation of the characteristics of impermanence, suffering and impersonality of the various objects of concentration, such as the out-breath and the
in-breath, as well as the material and mental aggregates;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then, through the brilliant manifestation of the 37 factors of Awakening, he fully knows the aggregate of suffering, including ignorance as a cause and volitional
impulses as an effect. With the clear discrimination of Dependent Origination, all doubts about doctrine, or all sixteen doubts about mind and matter, that might arise in the three phases of time (past, present, and future)
due to ignorance of Dependent Origination, vanish in the stream of consciousness of that Arhat, just as dewdrops vanish with the appearance of the sun&#39;s rays.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">In the middle watch of the night, the Buddha continuously contemplated dependent origination in the forward and backward order throughout the entire watch. As he
contemplated, his understanding of Nibbana, the cessation of cause, became clearer and clearer. This resulted in the continuous arising of a series of such mental impulses in the Buddha, which were spontaneous and connected
with knowledge and happiness, preceded by wisdom and rapture. Since he could not contain this rapture, he again uttered another sublime saying (Ud. 1.2) as if rapture had overwhelmed him:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Yad&#257; have p&#257;tu-bhavanti dhamm&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&#257;t&#257;pino jh&#257;yato br&#257;hma&#7751;assa,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">athassa ka&#7749;kh&#257; vapayanti sabb&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">yato khaya&#7745; paccay&#257;na&#7745; aved&#299;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When the 37 factors of Awakening are clearly manifested in the stream of consciousness of the Arhat, who:</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">1. freed from all evil</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">2. endowed with the right diligence to burn away 1500 impurities</span></p>
<p class="tm27"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">3. whose meditation is so steady and sharp that it reaches the path of absorption,</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">through contemplation of the characteristics of impermanence, suffering and impersonality of the various objects of concentration, such as the out-breath and the
in-breath, as well as the material and mental aggregates;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">then, thanks to this bright manifestation of the 37 factors of Awakening&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote2"><span class="tm15">2</span></a><a id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm15">, he penetrates into the unconditioned Nibbana, the cessation of all causes such as ignorance,
volitional impulses, etc. By clearly discerning the unconditioned final Nibbana, called the destruction of causes (paccayakkhaya), all doubts that might arise due to ignorance of Nibbana vanish in the stream of consciousness
of that Arhat, just as dewdrops vanish with the advent of the sun&#39;s heat.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">During the last watch of the night, the Buddha continuously contemplated the teaching of dependent origination in the forward and reverse order throughout the entire
watch. As he contemplated in this way, his understanding of the noble path, which sees fully the continuous arising and cessation of the cycle of suffering, became clearer and clearer.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">This led to the continuous arising in the Buddha of a series of such mental impulses, which were spontaneous and connected with knowledge and happiness, preceded
by wisdom and rapture. Since he could not contain this rapture, he again uttered the third sublime saying (Ud. 1.3) because of this rapture preceded by wisdom, as if the rapture had overwhelmed him:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Yad&#257; have p&#257;tu-bhavanti dhamm&#257;,</span></em></p>

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">The seven days during which the Buddha gazed steadily at the Maha Bodhi tree and the unconquered (apar&#257;jita) throne without closing his eyes are known as
the seven days without blinking (animisa-satt&#257;ha).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After attaining Buddhahood and enjoying the bliss of Arhatship, without changing his cross-legged posture, the Buddha remained on the undefeated throne for seven
days. In the minds of some ordinary Devas and Brahmas, partly because they had the experience of attaining the paths and fruits during the time of previous Buddhas, doubts arose as they reflected: &quot;The Buddha has not
yet risen from the throne. Apart from the qualities he already possesses, are there any other qualities that would enable him to attain Buddhahood?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then on the eighth day of the waning moon, the Buddha rose from the delight of Awakening. Knowing the doubts of the Devas and Brahmas, he rose into the sky and performed
the double miracle of water and fire to remove their doubts.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">The double miracle shown here at the Maha Bodhi tree, and at the assembly of his relatives in the city of Kapilavatthu and at the assembly formed because of the
heretic Pathikaputta in the city of Vesali, was the same as that performed at the Kandamba mango tree. A detailed account of the latter will be given later in the chapter: The 6th Rainy Season (Miracles).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Having removed the doubts of the Devas and Brahmas by means of the double miracle of water and fire, the Buddha descended from the sky and stood erect, like a golden
pillar, on a spot northeast of the unconquered throne, thinking: &#8220;I have indeed attained omniscience.&#8221; He spent seven days without closing his eyes, but looking at the throne and the Maha Bodhi tree, where he had
attained knowledge of the path of the Arhat (Arahatta-magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) and omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) as a result of the perfections he had accomplished over four immeasurable
periods and 100,000 eons. This place is known as the Sanctuary of the Unblinking Eye&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote4"><span

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">In the third week, the Buddha spent seven days walking back and forth along the precious path created by the Devas and Brahmas and extending from east to west between
the Invincible Throne and the Sanctuary of Unblinking Eyes, while he reflected on the Dhamma and dwelt in the attainment of fruition (phala-sam&#257;patti). This place is called the Sanctuary of the Precious Path (Ratana-ca&#7749;kama-cetiya).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">4. A week in a precious pavilion.</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">In the fourth week, the Buddha contemplated the highest teaching of Abhidhamma, sitting cross-legged in the jewel pavilion (Ratana-ghara) created by the Devas and
Brahmas, in the northwest corner of the Maha Bodhi tree.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">According to the subcommentary of the Ornaments of the Conqueror (Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra), when the Buddha there sat cross-legged and reflected on the Dhamma
and surveyed beings worthy of training, he perfectly discerned the path of practice consisting of virtue, concentration, and wisdom (s&#299;la-sam&#257;dhi-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;). He saw that humans, Devas, and Brahmas
would attain the noble state of the paths, fruits, and Nibbana by establishing themselves in virtue (s&#299;la), concentrating their minds (sam&#257;dhi), and making efforts to develop wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;). Therefore
the Buddha reflected first on the Basket of Discipline (Vinaya-pi&#7789;aka), which teaches morality, then on the Basket of Suttas (Sutta-pi&#7789;aka), which teaches concentration, and finally on the Basket of Abhidhamma
(Abhidhamma-pi&#7789;aka), which teaches wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When he contemplated the Abhidhamma, he first considered the six lower treatises: the Enumeration of Phenomena (Dhamma-sa&#7749;ga&#7751;&#299;), the Analyses (Vibha&#7749;ga),
the Discussion of the Elements (Dh&#257;tu-kath&#257;), the Description of Persons (Puggala-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;atti), the Debates (Kath&#257;-vatthu), and the Pairs (Yamaka), but at that time no effulgence arose because his
omniscience was comparatively vast and the doctrinal methods in these treatises were comparatively limited. But when he contemplated the seventh treatise on the all-embracing Causal Relations (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na) with
its unlimited methods (ananta-naya-samanta), his omniscience found an opportunity to display its vast effulgence, just as the giant fish Timingala, 1000 leagues in size, is given the opportunity to play only in the great ocean.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When the Buddha directed his mind to the subtlest and deepest aspects of the all-encompassing Causal Relationships (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na) with an unlimited number
of methods, great rapture arose in his stream of consciousness. Because of this rapture, his blood became purer; because of his purer blood, his skin became purer; because of his purer skin, a radiance the size of a house
or a mountain emanated from the front of his body and spread, permeating the countless elements of the worlds in the east, just as Chaddant, the king of elephants, flies in the sky.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">In the same way, a radiance appeared from the Buddha&#39;s back and rushed toward the countless elements of the worlds in the west; a radiance appeared from the Buddha&#39;s
right side and rushed toward the countless elements of the worlds in the south; a radiance appeared from the left side and rushed toward the countless elements of the worlds in the north; and from the soles of his feet a coral-colored
radiance appeared, plunging into the space below after penetrating the mass of earth, the mass of water, and the mass of air, just as a chain studded with sapphires was turning; balls of blue radiance rose one after another
from his head, reaching the space above, having passed through the six abodes of the Devas and the 20 abodes of the Brahmas of the sense-world sphere (k&#257;m&#257;vacara). At that time, countless beings in the countless
elements of the worlds shone with a golden light.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">The radiance that emanated from the body of the Buddha on the day when he contemplated the teaching of Patthana still moves to the countless elements of the worlds
as an unbroken chain of matter conditioned by temperature (utuja-r&#363;pa).</span></em></p>

<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">The Blessed Buddha, the Lord of the Three Worlds, pondered the seven books of the Abhidhamma, namely, the Enumeration of Phenomena, the Analyses, the Discussion of
the Elements, the Description of Persons, the Discussions, the Pairs, and the Causal Relations, while residing at Ratanaghara in the middle of the seven weeks he spent on the throne, one week at each place: unblinking contemplation,
the meditation path, the Jewel Pavilion. (ratana-ghara-satt&#257;ha), at the Ajap&#257;la tree (Ajap&#257;la-satt&#257;ha), at Mucalinda (Mucalinda-satt&#257;ha) and at the Royal tree (R&#257;j&#257;yatana-satt&#257;ha).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">He reflected by means of his omniscience, which is incomparably deep, subtle and powerful due to the variety of perfections accumulated over countless aeons. Then,
by applying his wisdom, he attained a survey of the all-embracing Causal Relations (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na), which, with its various methods and combinations, is even vaster and deeper than the ocean of 84,000 leagues surrounded
by a mountain range. Having thus attained the Causal Relations, his omniscience, incomparably deep, subtle and powerful due to the variety of glorious perfections accumulated over countless aeons, was able to manifest its
radiance.</span></p>

deep, surrounded by mountains. Similarly, the Buddha&#39;s omniscience, uniquely profound, subtle and powerful due to the variety of glorious perfections accumulated over aeons, got the opportunity to manifest its radiance
only when reflecting on the Causal Relations (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na).</span></p>

different colours spread everywhere, left and right, forward and backward, up and down, due to the pure and effulgent state of his blood and so on, which arose while pondering the doctrine of Causal Relations (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na),
which was as subtle as atomic particles. He is the Teacher who poured out his words of instruction from his joyful, golden heart to the beings of the three worlds: humans, devas and brahmas.</span></p>

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">From the blue-black parts of the Buddha&#39;s body, such as his hair and the pupils of his eyes, a blue-black radiance emanated. Shining brightly, this radiance -
somewhat grayish, bluish and greenish, like a butterfly pea, a blue lotus and blue antimony - coloring the whole sky and earth blue, or like blue fans of rubies and fabrics that sway softly and smoothly, has been spreading
since the day when the Buddha contemplated the Causal Relationships (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na), and continues to spread to this day.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">From the yellow and golden parts of the Buddha&#39;s body, such as the skin, there emanated a yellow and golden radiance the size of a. Shining brightly, this radiance
covered the ten directions, making them yellow, like a golden cloth sprinkled with liquid gold and spread around, or like saffron and realgar powder, and golden Ka&#7751;ik&#257;ra flowers filling the sky, and has continued
to spread from the day the Buddha contemplated the Causal Relationships (Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na) until now.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">From the white parts of his body, such as his bones, teeth, and the whites of his eyes, a white radiance of size emanated. Shining brightly, this radiance is like
a stream of milk pouring from a silver jug, or a silver canopy completely covering the sky, or silver fans gently and smoothly waving among the high clouds in the sky, or a mixture of silver jasmine, Maghya, white lotus, jasmine
(sumana), and Muggara, and continues to spread from the day the Buddha meditated on Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na until now.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">From the red parts of his body, such as his eyes, flesh and blood, a red radiance of the size of a hundred pounds emanated. Shining brightly, this red radiance, like
red lead powder, molten lacquer, China rose, the flower of the midday sun flower (bandhu-j&#299;vaka), the flower of the Indian coral tree (p&#257;rij&#257;ta), coloring the surface of the earth, water and the whole sky red,
continues to spread from the day when the Buddha meditated on Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na until now.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Moreover, from various indefinite places on the Buddha&#39;s body there came radiances of light and dark shades (ma&ntilde;je&#7789;&#7789;ha), arising from the mixture
of black, red and blue, and radiances of sparkling, flaming and glittering shades (pabhassara) in size. Shining brightly, this radiance, like lightning in the sky in the month of Ves&#257;kha, or like the skin of playing insects,
or sparks of blazing fire, has continued to spread from the day when the Buddha meditated on Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na until now.</span></p>

could illuminate all 10,000 worlds with just a snap of their fingers, disappeared because they could not outshine the Buddha&#39;s radiance.</span></p>

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">I bow in deep respect to the Buddha, the Lord of the World. He received the name Angirasa because he radiated the wondrous radiance of the six colours described above.
His noble qualities and good fame spread throughout the three worlds (the world of humans, devas and brahmas). The whole world reveres him, for he is worthy of the highest respect. He perfectly comprehended the Four Noble
Truths - they were as clear to him as if they were inscribed on the palm of his hand, shining like a living ruby.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">I, however, reflecting on my body, see that it consists of 32 impure parts, causing disgust. And yet I, so imperfect, with deep faith and devotion bow my head before
the Buddha, mentally returning to those times when the Blessed One still dwelt in this world.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">The Pathana doctrine of causal relations has a limitless number of methods, like the sky; it is vast like the mass of the earth; it is deep like the thickness of
the ocean waters. Yet the Buddha completed its review in only seven days, for omniscience is vast and swift in its application. The place where the Buddha contemplated this Dhamma Jewel for seven days became known as Ratana-ghara-cetiya,
or the Jewel Pavilion.</span></p>

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">5. A week at the banyan tree Ajapala</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After spending four weeks near the Maha Bodhi tree, in the fifth week the Buddha went to the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, located to the east of the Maha Bodhi
tree, and remained at the foot of that tree for seven full days, reflecting on the Dhamma and remaining in the state of the Fruit of Awakening (phala-sam&#257;patti).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">The banyan tree got its name because the goat herders (aja-p&#257;la) used to gather there; therefore that banyan tree under whose shade the goat herders used
to take shelter was called Ajapala-nigrodha.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">At this time, a brahmin of unknown lineage and name, apparently of violent and arrogant nature, approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. The brahmin
then stood at a suitable distance and asked the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Gotama, what virtues make a man a true brahmin (br&#257;hma&#7751;a) in this world? What is required to become noble?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">The arrogant brahmin could not realize the four noble truths even if the Buddha made him a disciple and taught him. The Buddha had not yet preached the discourse
on setting in motion the Wheel of Dhamma. Those who heard the Buddha reciting the Dhamma verses before his preaching of the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhamma-cakka) could only receive benefit as a good impression or imprint on the mind,
like the taking of refuge by the merchant brothers Tapussa and Bhallika, who could never realize the paths and fruits through realization of the four truths. This is the natural law (dhammat&#257;) according to the Explanation
of the Profound Meaning (S&#257;rattha-d&#299;pan&#299;). Since the arrogant brahmin could not perceive the Dhamma because he was unable to discern the four truths, the Buddha did not make him a disciple. But realizing the
meaning of the brahmin&#39;s question, the Buddha uttered this sublime saying (Ud. 1.4):</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">An Arahant, called a Brahmin, is one who is freed from all evil. He is free from violence and arrogance; he is free from the stains of defilements (&#257;sava); he
is intent on developing meditation, or his heart is subdued by morality; or he has attained Nibbana, the true cessation of volitional impulses, having realized it through the four knowledges of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a);
or he has attained the fruition stage of Arahant (Arahatta-phala), the culmination of the four knowledges of the path.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">He has completed the noble practice of the path leading to Nibbana. In this world where everything arises and disappears, there is absolutely no five evil predominances

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Mara followed the Buddha for seven years, trying to find some fault in him, but he could not find any possibility of doing so. So he approached the Buddha, who was
standing at the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, and recited in verse:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Hermit Gotama, are you sitting here in the forest overcome with grief? Have you lost property worth hundreds and thousands? Or are you meditating here because
you want to acquire property worth hundreds and thousands? Or are you sitting here in this forest because you have committed a serious offense in the village or city and do not dare to show yourself to people? Why do you not
make friends? You have no friendship at all with anyone!&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Buddha replied:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Mara, I have rooted out and destroyed all causes of grief. I do not have even the slightest particle of evil. Being completely free from anxiety, I remain
absorbed in the two absorptions. I have cut off craving for existence (bhava-ta&#7751;h&#257;). I have no attachment. I remain in the bliss of the two forms of absorption.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Mara:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Ascetic Gotama, in this world some people and ascetics are attached to their valuables such as gold and silver, and to their belongings such as robes and
bowl, saying, &#39;This is mine.&#39; If your mind is attached, like these people and ascetics, to this gold and silver, and to this robes and bowl, you will never be able to escape my power in the three existences.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Buddha:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Mara, I have no attachment to things such as gold and silver, nor to paraphernalia such as robes and a bowl, saying, &#39;This is mine.&#39; Unlike others,
I am not one who says, &#39;This is mine.&#39; O Mara, know me as such! Because I have left the three existences, you will never see my path in your domains such as the three existences (bhava), the four modes of birth (yoni),
the five paths (gati&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote5"><span class="tm15">5</span></a><a id="footnote5back"></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm15">), seven states of consciousness (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-&#7789;hiti&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote6"><span

<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Mara:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Hermit Gotama, if you know the good, reliable path leading to Awakening, go alone.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Buddha:</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Mara, no matter how you try to hinder me, I will reveal the path leading to Nibanna, free from death.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Hearing this, Mara, being completely at a loss, like a crab whose claw had been broken by the village children, recited the following two verses, admitting his defeat:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Meda-va&#7751;&#7751;a&ntilde;-ca p&#257;s&#257;&#7751;a&#7745;, v&#257;yaso anupariyag&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">apettha mudu&#7745; vindema, api ass&#257;dan&#257; siy&#257;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;O Buddha named Gotama, descendant of the great Maha-sammata! There is a parable about how a hungry, stupid crow jumped in all eight directions around a stone
that looked like a piece of fat, trying to tear it with its beak, thinking that it would find in it a soft piece of fat with meat, and that its taste would be truly delicious and would spread throughout the body.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Aladdh&#257; tattha ass&#257;da&#7745;, v&#257;yasetto apakkame,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">k&#257;ko va selam-&#257;sajja, nibbijj&#257;pema Gotama.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Not finding any delicious taste in that stone, the foolish crow left it. Like that foolish crow, not finding any pleasure in the least, although it tried to tear
the stone that looked like a lump of fat, and flew away, we retreat, feeling sad and despondent, being unable to achieve what we want after trying to annoy and hinder you.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After this, Mara reflected thus: &quot;Although I have always followed the Buddha to find faults in him, I have not been able to find even the slightest fault worthy
of blame. Now Siddhattha has gone beyond my power in the three worlds.&quot; Thus he reflected, and being dejected, he sat alone on the main road near the Buddha and drew sixteen lines on the ground, reflecting on sixteen
events. These sixteen lines meant:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">1. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of generosity (d&#257;na p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason, I cannot
be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the first line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">2. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of morality (s&#299;la p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot be
his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the second line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">3. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of renunciation (nekkhamma p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot
be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the third line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">4. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason,
I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the fourth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">5. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of diligence (viriya p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot be his
equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the fifth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">6. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of patience (khanti p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot be his
equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the sixth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">7. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of truthfulness (sacca p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot be
his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the seventh line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">8. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of determination (adhi&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For
this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the eighth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">9. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not fulfilled the perfection of goodwill (mett&#257; p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot be
his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the ninth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">10. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not achieved the perfection of equanimity (upekkh&#257; p&#257;ram&#299;) in my past existences. For this reason I cannot
be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the tenth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">11. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not accomplished the ten perfections in my past existences to gain knowledge of the thoughts and intentions of others (indriya-paro-pariyatti-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),
which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the eleventh line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">12. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not accomplished the ten perfections in my past existences to gain knowledge of the tendencies and dispositions of others
(&#257;say&#257;nusaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the twelfth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">13. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not accomplished the ten perfections in my past existences to gain the knowledge of the attainment of great compassion
(mah&#257;-karu&#7751;&#257;-sam&#257;patti-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the thirteenth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">14. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not performed the ten perfections in my past existences to gain the knowledge of the performance of the paired miracle
(yamaka-p&#257;&#7789;ih&#257;riya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the fourteenth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">15. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not accomplished the ten perfections in my past existences to gain unimpeded knowledge (an&#257;vara&#7751;a-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),
which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the fifteenth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">16. &quot;Unlike Prince Siddhattha, I have not accomplished the ten perfections in my past existences to gain omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),
which is not generally available. For this reason I cannot be his equal.&quot; With this thought, Mara drew the sixteenth line.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">Daughters of Mara</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">At that time, Mara&#39;s three daughters, Tanha (thirst), Arati (dissatisfaction) and Raga (passion), were looking around, thinking, &quot;We do not see our father
Mara, where is he now?&quot; and saw him dejectedly, sitting and drawing lines on the ground. They quickly approached him and asked, &quot;Father, why do you look so sad and dejected?&quot; &quot;Dear daughters,&quot; Mara
replied, &quot;this ascetic Gotama has gone beyond my control in the three worlds. Although I have been watching him for these seven years to find his faults, I have not been able to find the slightest opportunity to reproach
him for anything wrong. That is why I am so sad and dejected.&quot; &quot;Father, please do not worry. We will seduce this ascetic Gotama and bring him to you,&quot; promised the three daughters.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then Mara said, &quot;Dear daughters, no one in the world is able to seduce this ascetic Gotama. He is firmly established in his unshakable faith.&quot; &quot;Father,
we will bind him with the fetters of passion and quickly bring him to you. Please do not be disappointed or worried.&quot; Having said this, the three divine maidens approached the Buddha and said to him seductively, &quot;Venerable
ascetic, allow us to serve you by sitting respectfully at your feet and satisfying all your needs.&quot; However, the Buddha ignored them and continued to enjoy the bliss of Nibbana, remaining in the attainment of fruition
(phala-sam&#257;patti), without opening his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Mara&#39;s three daughters discussed among themselves, &quot;Men have different tastes. Some like young and tender women, others prefer women in the initial phase
of life. And some prefer those in the middle phase. So let us assume different ages and try to seduce this ascetic.&quot; Accordingly, each of them created the corresponding forms of women: 1) the form of young women; 2) the
form of women before giving birth; 3) the form of women who have given birth once; 4) the form of women who have given birth twice; 5) the form of middle-aged women; and 6) the form of elderly women - each of them was created
beautiful. They then approached the Buddha six times and spoke seductively as before, &quot;Venerable ascetic, allow us to serve you by sitting respectfully at your feet and satisfying all your needs.&quot; As on previous
occasions, the Buddha ignored them and continued to enjoy the bliss of Nibbana, remaining in the attainment of fruition (phala-sam&#257;patti), without opening his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After this the Buddha said, &quot;Go away, deities. What benefit did you think you would gain by tempting me in this way? Such things can only be done to those who
are not yet free from passion (r&#257;ga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). As for me, I have completely rid myself of these defilements.&quot; The Buddha then spoke the following two verses, as mentioned in the Dhammapada
(Dhp 179-180):</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Yassa jita&#7745; n&#257;vaj&#299;yati,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">jita&#7745; yassa no y&#257;ti koci loke,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">ta&#7745; Buddham-ananta-gocara&#7745;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">apada&#7745; kena padena nessatha?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;Whose victory cannot be defeated,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Whose victory no one in the world can surpass,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">That Awakened One, with the boundless expanse of knowledge,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;Leaving no traces - which way will you lead?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;I&#39;m looking for a visa,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">ta&#7751;h&#257; natthi kuhi&ntilde;ci netave,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">ta&#7745; Buddham-ananta-gocara&#7745;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">apada&#7745; kena padena nessatha?&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;Whoever has no entangling net,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">No thirst that could lead somewhere,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">That Awakened One, with the boundless expanse of knowledge,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;Leaving no traces - which way will you lead?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Our father has told us the truth. This ascetic Gotama, endowed with the qualities of Arahat (completely liberated) and Bhagav&#257; (Blessed), cannot be seduced by
passion.&quot; Then Mara&#39;s daughters returned to their father.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm29"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">Buddha honors Dhamma</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When the Buddha was staying for a week at the Ajapala banyan tree, he thought: &quot;It is truly good to pay respect to others. To whom should I turn and whom should
I hold in high esteem? He who has got rid of all defilements (kilesa), who has removed all evil?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then he reflected thus: &#8220;Should I find someone who is superior to me in morality (s&#299;la), concentration (sam&#257;dhi), wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)
and liberation (vimutti), so that I can live in due respect to him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">He then searched with his omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;uta&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) to find someone who was superior to him in morality, concentration, wisdom
and liberation. Not seeing such a person in the three worlds, he thought: &quot;It will be good if I live paying homage only to the Dhamma that I have realized.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">At that moment, knowing the Buddha&#39;s intention, Brahma Sahampati instantly appeared before the Buddha and, throwing his robe over his left shoulder and touching
the ground with his right knee, raised his hands folded in reverence and said: &quot;Exalted Buddha, what you have reflected on is correct. Blessed One, those Buddhas who appeared in the past lived by respecting only the Dhamma.
Those Buddhas who will appear in the future will also live by respecting only the Dhamma. Exalted Buddha, as the present Buddha, you too should live by respecting only the Dhamma.&quot; He also added the following three verses:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Ye ca at&#299;t&#257; Sambuddh&#257;, ye ca Buddh&#257; an&#257;gat&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">yo cetarahi Sambuddho, bah&#363;na&#7745; sokan&#257;sano.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">All the Samma-sambuddhas of the past and the Buddhas that will come,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">And he who is now Sambuddha is the destroyer of the sorrow of many.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Sabbe Saddhamma-garuno, viha&#7745;su viharanti ca,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">tath&#257;pi viharissanti, es&#257; Buddh&#257;na&#39; dhammat&#257;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">They all honored the Noble Dhamma, they honor it now,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">And they will be honored in the future - such is the law for all Buddhas.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Tasm&#257; hi attak&#257;mena, mahattam-abhika&#7749;khat&#257;,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Saddhammo garuk&#257;tabbo, sara&#7745; Buddh&#257;na&#39; s&#257;sana&#7745;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Therefore, he who desires good for himself and strives for greatness,</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">One should revere the Noble Dhamma, remembering the teachings of the Buddhas.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Having recited these three verses, Brahma Sahampati paid homage to the Buddha, circumambulated him, and disappeared from that place, appearing in his own Brahma abode.
Then, fully realizing that Brahma Sahampati&#39;s request was quite appropriate, the Buddha lived his life paying homage to the Dhamma he had realized.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">Later, the Sangha appeared and the Sangha became complete in the four greatnesses (mahatta):</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">1) The Greatness of the Elders (ratta&ntilde;&ntilde;u-mahatta)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">2) Greatness in the number of members of the Sangha (vepulla-mahatta)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">3) The greatness of holy life (brahmacariya-mahatta)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">4) Greatness in material offerings (l&#257;bhagga-mahatta)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm23">At this time, the Buddha also began to pay respects to the Sangha. For this reason, when his aunt Maha Pajapati Gotami offered him a pair of cloths for robes,
the Buddha said, &quot;Dear aunt, offer this to the Sangha. Offering to the Sangha will mean offering to both me and the Sangha.&quot; In this way, the Buddha clearly showed his respect and reverence for the Sangha.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After seven days of contemplating the Dhamma under the Ajapala banyan tree, the Buddha went to the Muchalinda tree, which was located to the east of the Maha Bodhi
tree. There, at the foot of the Muchalinda tree, the Buddha spent seven days sitting cross-legged and enjoying the bliss of Arahanthood.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">At that time, there was a very heavy rain for seven days. Such rain falls only on two occasions: when the Universal Monarch (Chakkavatti) appears and when the Buddha
appears. When this great rain began, the very powerful Naga King, Muchalinda, who ruled the Naga abode and lived in the lake that was near the tree where the Buddha stopped, thought thus: &quot;This great rain began as soon
as the Buddha stopped near my abode. It would be good to find a suitable shelter for the Buddha.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">The Naga King had enough power to create a large palace of seven kinds of jewels by himself, but he thought, &quot;It will not be of much use if I create a large
jewel palace and offer it to the Buddha. I will serve him with my body.&quot; So he assumed a huge physical form and wrapped his coils around the Buddha&#39;s body seven times, and also covered the Buddha&#39;s head with his
open hood to protect him from cold, heat, midges, mosquitoes, flies, etc.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Thus the Buddha remained within the seven coils of the Naga King Mucalinda and spent seven days enjoying the bliss of the Arahat state, as if spending time in a spacious,
fragrant chamber. When the Naga King looked up at the sky and saw that it was free of clouds and there was no longer any need to cover the Buddha, he abandoned his Naga form and assumed the form of a youth standing before
the Buddha with his hands folded in reverence.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then, reflecting and realizing the fact that &#8220;For one who enjoys the bliss of Nibbana, happiness arises wherever he may be,&#8221; the Buddha uttered the following
two solemn, sublime sayings (Ud. 2.1):</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Sukho viveko tu&#7789;&#7789;hassa, suta-dhammassa passato,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">aby&#257;pajja&#7745; sukha&#7745; loke, p&#257;&#7751;a-bh&#363;tesu sa&#7745;yamo.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Nibbana, which is seclusion from the four bases of rebirth (upadhi), is bliss. Without the manifestation of anger, but only with goodwill (mett&#257;) towards men,
devas and brahmas, for one who is pleased with his attainment through the four path knowledges, who has realized the Dhamma through wisdom, or who has penetrated the Dhamma and seen with his wisdom&#39;s eyes Nibbana, which
is free from the four bases of rebirth and the Dhammas worthy of knowledge, this is bliss in this world. The development of compassion (karu&#7751;&#257;), the practice of the Brahmavih&#257;ras, free from violence and cruelty,
is bliss.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">Sukh&#257; vir&#257;gat&#257; loke, k&#257;m&#257;na&#7745; samatikkamo,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">asmim&#257;nassa yo vinayo, eta&#7745; ve parama&#7745; sukha&#7745;.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">The noble path of Non-return (an&#257;g&#257;mi-magga), which gives rise to the knowledge of detachment from passion, which resists and avoids, uprooting sensual
pleasures, is bliss in this world. There is the fruit of arhatship, which completely eliminates the idea of &quot;I am.&quot; This fruit of arhatship is indeed the highest happiness of all conditioned things.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">7. Week at the Rajayatana Tree</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After enjoying the bliss of arhatship for seven days at the foot of the Muchalinda tree, in the seventh week the Buddha moved to the Rajayatana tree, located south
of the Mahabodhi tree, and sat at its foot, enjoying the bliss of arhatship for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Thus the 49 days were completed. During these days the Buddha did none of the following: he did not rinse his mouth, wash his face, cleanse his body; he did not bathe,
eat food, drink water, or lie down. He spent the time completely absorbed in the bliss of the jhanas and the fruit of attainment (phala-sam&#257;patti).</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">When the 49 days were completed, on Wednesday, the fifth day of the waxing moon in the month of Asalha (July), while staying at the Rajayatana tree, Sakha (the ruler
of the gods) appeared and offered the medicinal myrobalan fruit, knowing the Buddha&#39;s desire to wash and purify himself. The Buddha ate the fruit. As soon as he ate the fruit, he satisfied his natural needs. After this,
Sakha gave him a toothpick from the abode of the nagas and water from the Anotatta lake. The Buddha used the toothpick, rinsed his mouth, washed his face and remained sitting under the Rajayatana tree.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm14">Tapussa and Bhallika</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Two merchant brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika, were traveling with many carts from their home in the country of Ukkala to the Middle Country (Majjhima-desa) to trade.
As they were traveling along the main road and approaching a Rajayatana tree, their carts suddenly stopped as if stuck in mud, although the ground was level and dry. Just as they were wondering, &quot;What is the reason?&quot;
and discussing it among themselves, a deity who had been their close relative in a previous life appeared in physical form from the fork of the tree and said, &quot;Young men, the newly enlightened Buddha, absorbed in the
bliss of an arhat, is staying at the foot of the Rajayatana tree without taking any food for the full 49 days. Young men, honor and pay respect to the Buddha with an offering of food. This will bring you well-being and happiness
for a long time.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Hearing this, they were very happy and, thinking, &quot;It will take time to cook the rice,&quot; they went to the Buddha, taking with them the rice cakes and honey
balls they had with them. Approaching the Buddha, they respectfully saluted him and, remaining at a proper distance, said, &quot;May the Blessed One (Bhagav&#257;) accept our rice cakes and honey balls. Your acceptance will
be the cause of our well-being and happiness for a long time.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After this, the Buddha thought, &quot;My Buddha predecessors never accepted offerings of food with their hands. So how should I now accept these rice cakes and honey
balls offered by these merchant brothers?&quot; The clay bowl given by Brahma Ghatikara at the time of his renunciation disappeared on the day he received milk rice from Sujata. Knowing the Buddha&#39;s thoughts, the Four
Great Kings of the four directions, namely Dhataratha, Virulhaka, Virupakkha and Kuvera, respectfully offered him four bowls made of blue stone. However, the Buddha refused to accept them. Then the Four Great Kings gave the
Buddha four bowls made of natural stone the color of green moong. The Buddha accepted these four bowls and, out of compassion and goodwill for the deva kings, he placed one bowl on top of the other and by means of idhi the
four bowls became one bowl with four rims.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Then the Buddha accepted the rice cakes and honey food in that alms bowl, ate them, and delivered a discourse suitable for the merchant brothers. Then the two brothers
took refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma only, since the Sangha treasure had not yet appeared at that time, and thus they became devoted followers who only recite the two-part formula of refuge (dev&#257;cika-sara&#7751;a)
pertaining to the Buddha and the Dhamma, saying:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm19">&quot;Ete maya&#7745; bhante, Bhagavanta&#7745; sara&#7751;a&#7745; gacch&#257;ma Dhamma&ntilde;-ca&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm17"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;We take refuge in the Blessed One and the Dhamma.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">Two merchants became the first lay followers in whom the two-part formula for refuge was established.</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">After this, two merchant brothers made a request:</span></p>
<p class="tm22"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm15">&quot;Blessed Buddha, give us something, out of compassion for us, to which we may incline our minds in veneration, delighting and establishing the mind in the good
dhammas.&quot; Then the Buddha gave them his hair, granting their request. Upon receiving the hair, the brothers were overjoyed, as if ambrosia had been spilled on them. Having completed the trade, they returned to their hometown
of Pukkharavati in the Ukkala district, where they built a stupa (cetiya), placing in it the hair relics, kept in a golden casket.</span></p>
