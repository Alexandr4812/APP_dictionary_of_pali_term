<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Having defeated Vasavatti Mara, also known as Devaputta Mara, before sunset on the full moon of the month of Vesak in 528 BCE, the Bodhisatta successively realized
the three knowledges (vijj&#257;):<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm24"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">1. Knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) in the first watch of that night;</span></p>
<p class="tm24"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">2. Knowledge of the divine vision or eye (dibba-cakkhu-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) in the middle watch of the night;</span></p>
<p class="tm26"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">3. Knowledge of the destruction of defilements (&#257;savakkhaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) in the last watch of the night.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">And so he became Buddha on the very last watch of the full moon night of the month of Vesak.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">Knowledge of Past Existences</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The physical and mental processes that took place in the past, personal names, family names, and so on, which are merely conventional designations&#8212;all these,
relating to the past, are called past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;sa). The superknowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;) that accompanies the recollection of past existences is the knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;).
The Buddha taught this as the first of the three knowledges (vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Here is a detailed description of how the first knowledge was realized by the Bodhisatta:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When the noble Bodhisatta was sitting on the undefeated throne after defeating Vasavatti Mara, many Devas and Brahmas residing in the 10,000 world system, including
earthly spirits (bhumma-deva), simultaneously came to the Bodhisatta and gathered together, exclaiming: &quot;Come, Devas and Brahmas, the victory of the noble Bodhisatta and the defeat of Mara have become evident. Let us
all hold a celebration in honor of the noble Bodhisatta&#39;s victory and his future attainment of Buddhahood.&quot;<br /><br />At that moment, a majestic radiance, like a golden disk fifty yojanas in diameter, began to slowly
fade in the west, like the golden wheel of a celestial chariot sinking into the depths of the ocean. From the east, as if rising from the milky ocean, a cool silvery radiance forty yojanas in diameter appeared, like the wheel
of a divine chariot thrown into the sky by an invisible hand.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">In the middle of this space, illuminated by golden light, sat the Bodhisatta. His presence was so majestic that it seemed as if everything around the Mahabodhi tree,
both living and non-living, had been immersed in a stream of molten gold. Seated in the lotus position on the invincible throne at the foot of the Mahabodhi tree, the Bodhisatta was deep in meditation on the Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">At that time, in the heavenly realm of Tavatimsa, Sakka blew the divine conch Vijayuttara, summoning the devas and brahmas. The sound of this conch resounded throughout
the realm, which was 10,000 yojanas wide. Without ceasing to blow, Sakka hurried to the Bodhi tree. And not only the Sakka of this universe, but also the Sakkas of the other 10,000 worlds rushed toward the Bodhisatta, filling
the space with the sounds of divine conchs.<br /><br />Maha Brahma arrived and paid homage, holding a white umbrella, and covered the Bodhisatta with it from above; and all the Brahmas of the other 10,000 world systems arrived
and stood holding their white umbrellas, touching each other so that there was no gap between them.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Suyama, the king of the abode of the Yama devas, also arrived and stood near the Bodhisatta, paying homage by fanning him with a yakkha tail fan; and all the Suyama
devas from the other 10,000 world systems also arrived and paid homage, each holding a yakkha tail fan, filling that entire world-element.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Santusitta, the king of the abode of the Tusita world devas, also arrived and paid respects by fanning the Bodhisatta with a round ruby fan; and all the Santusitta
devas from the other 10,000 world systems also arrived and paid respects, each holding a round ruby fan, filling that entire world-element.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Pancasikha arrived carrying a celestial harp, accompanied by a group of celestial dancers, and offered obeisances with dancing, singing and music; and all the celestial
dancers residing in the other 10,000 world systems also arrived and offered obeisances with dancing, singing and music.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Moreover, all the male and female deities residing in the 10,000 world system gathered together in this world and paid their respects by taking their places nearby.
At this time, the entire sky was filled with cascading celestial flowers and celestial incense, as if the entire environment was filled with raindrops and rainwater from a heavy downpour.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">This grand celebration and ceremonial homage was performed with all pomp by all the Devas and Brahmas because they were inspired with faith:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">&quot;When the noble Bodhisatta becomes a Buddha, we will certainly have the opportunity to hear the Dhamma from him and thereby be able to obtain the deathless supramundane
dhamma of the paths, the fruits and Nibbana; and we will experience delightful satisfaction (p&#299;ti) by directing our minds to the nine supramundane dhammas of the four paths, the four fruits and Nibbana. We will also witness
all kinds of wonders, which will be objects of admiration to the eyes. The Buddha, by teaching us the deathless Dhamma, will bring about our liberation and safety from the arduous journey of birth (j&#257;ti), old age (jar&#257;),
disease (vy&#257;dhi), death (mara&#7751;a), sorrow (soka), lamentation (parideva), pain (dukkha), despondency (domanassa) and despair (up&#257;y&#257;sa).&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Although the devas and brahmas paid homage to him with great joy and respect, and although he clearly saw with his own eyes these extraordinary acts of homage performed
in various ways, the Bodhisatta had no feeling of attachment or enjoyment; and he paid no attention to them. He dwelt thinking only of the Dhamma, on which he relied as his support.<br />Because he dwelt only on the Dhamma,
his energy (viriya) was unflagging and very keen; his mindfulness (sati) was steady and clear, and he was physically and mentally very calm and peaceful. Therefore he attained and again dwelt absorbed in the first jhana of
the form realm (r&#363;p&#257;vacara-jh&#257;na).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The Bodhisatta&#39;s stream of consciousness, which was thus absorbed in the first jhana, was completely free from hindrances (n&#299;vara&#7751;a), and, being detached
from sense objects (vatthu-k&#257;ma) and sense desires (kilesa-k&#257;ma), delightful satisfaction (p&#299;ti) and happiness (sukha) arose in him in abundance.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Again, when the Bodhisatta attained and remained absorbed in the second jhana of the form realm, his stream of consciousness was free from directed thinking and investigation
(vitakka-vic&#257;ra); there was inner purity and clarity, and his concentration was exceptionally stable. Due to this concentration, his delightful satisfaction and happiness increased.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Again, when the Bodhisatta attained and remained absorbed in the third jhana of the form realm, even the delightful satisfaction that had manifested in his stream
of consciousness disappeared, and he dwelt only with a feeling of happiness (sukha-vedan&#257;). Having completely detached himself even from this feeling of happiness at its highest point, he became imbued with the mental
state of specific neutrality (tatra-majjhattat&#257;) or equanimity (jh&#257;nupekkha). His mindfulness became transparent, and his insight-wisdom became greatly sharpened.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Again, when the Bodhisatta attained and remained absorbed in the fourth jhana of the form realm, because he had already eliminated both physical and mental pain and
pleasure from his stream of consciousness, he remained in a state of tranquil contemplation of sense objects with equanimity (upekkh&#257;-vedan&#257;). Due to this equanimity and the mental state of specific neutrality (tatra-majjhattat&#257;),
his mental concomitants, such as mindfulness and others, which were an integral part of the fourth jhana, were as clear as moonlight.</span></p>

<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">If we now examine the Bodhisatta&#39;s stream of consciousness, we can see that at the time when he practiced severe austerities for six years, his stream of consciousness
was exceptionally pure, unstained by the three wrong thoughts (micch&#257;-vitakka), namely:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Sensual thoughts (k&#257;ma-vitakka),<br />Ill-willing thoughts (vy&#257;p&#257;da-vitakka) and<br />Cruel thoughts (vihi&#7745;s&#257;-vitakka),</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">So Mara could not find any opportunity to reproach him and destroy him.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Furthermore, when he spent the day in the Sala Grove on the full moon of the month of Vesak, the day on which he was to attain Enlightenment, his mind-stream was
worthy of veneration, having been highly purified by the attainment of the eight worldly absorptions. Moreover, when all the Devas and Brahmas of the 10,000 worlds assembled, filling this universe, and paid homage to him while
he sat on the undefeated throne after his victory over Devaputta Mara, he remained indifferent to them, focusing his attention only on the practice of the Dhamma. And so the Bodhisatta&#39;s mind-stream, which had again attained
and remained absorbed in the fourth jhana of the form realm (r&#363;p&#257;vacara-jh&#257;na), the attainment for those possessed of keen intelligence, had its power of concentration greatly enhanced by the concentration of
the fourth jhana of the form realm, as follows:</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">1. Due to the purest mental state of the fourth jhana of the form realm (r&#363;pa-jh&#257;na-cittupp&#257;da), the stream of consciousness was completely pure throughout
the entire process.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">2. Due to such purity, it shone like polished, freshly cleaned gold.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">3. Having abandoned happiness and joy (sukha-somanassa), which are the cause of greed (lobha), and having also abandoned sorrow and despondency (dukkha-domanassa),
which are the cause of hatred (dosa), he was free from the mental defilements of greed and hatred.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">4. Freedom from the defilements and obscurations of the mind leads to freedom from the impurities that defile and depress the mind (upakkilesa).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">5. Being controlled by the five kinds of mastery over the mind (vas&#299;-bh&#257;va)&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote1"><span class="tm13">1</span></a><a id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm22">and being tamed and trained in fourteen ways, the Bodhisatta&#39;s stream of consciousness
became pliable, soft, obedient to his desires, like well-tanned leather or a well-finished piece of lacquer.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">6. Being soft and pliable, like freshly purified, polished pure gold, which is pliable and malleable for making desired ornaments, it became obedient to the Bodhisattva&#39;s
wishes, enabling him to effectively and easily accomplish all kinds of achievements, such as remembering and discerning events of past existences, or seeing as with the divine eye distant objects, hidden objects, and very
subtle objects.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">7. Being well developed and trained so as not to lose the above qualities, the stream of consciousness remained firmly established in these qualities; or, being pliable
and plastic&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote2"><span class="tm13">2</span></a><a id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm22">In order to effectively achieve all that was desired, the flow of consciousness remained obedient to the will of the Bodhisattva.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">8. Being thus firmly and securely established, his mind was quite unshaken; or, being thus established, the stream of consciousness was very strong in regard to (5
forces)</span></p>
<p class="tm28"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">1. faith (saddh&#257;)<br />2. energy (viriya)<br />3. mindfulness (sati)<br />4. concentration (sam&#257;dhi)<br />5. wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;)</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Therefore, there was no wavering of mind which occurs due to disbelief, laziness, carelessness, anxiety, ignorance arising from mental defilements. In other words,
disbelief, laziness, etc. could not make even the slightest intrusion into the Bodhisattva&#39;s stream of consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The Bodhisatta&#39;s mind, endowed with these qualities, easily, requiring only intention, realizes the Dhamma which is to be realized through superknowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;).
When the mind was directed toward the object of superknowledge, moments of superknowledge thinking (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-javana) arose with complete ease.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">1. The attainment of super-knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;) was the first knowledge (vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The stream of consciousness endowed with the above-mentioned eight qualities, very pure and transparent, being in such a perfect state that the moment of thinking
of super-knowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-javana) arose easily, when the mind was directed to the object of super-knowledge, the Bodhisatta directed it to the super-knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;),
which could recall past actions, events and experiences. Thereafter, the super-knowledge of past existences arose easily in him. Through this super-knowledge he remembered and saw all his past actions, events and experiences
of his past existences, going back from his previous life up to the existence when he was the ascetic Sumedha. He also remembered, in reverse order, many existences and aeons before them, and remembered, in forward order,
his existences up to the existence as the deva Setaketu in the world of Tusita, immediately before the present one.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">This super-knowledge was attained in the first watch of the night. A doubt may arise here as to how it is possible to know all the events and experiences of so many
existences by one single mental process (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-javana), which arises only once in one thought process (v&#299;thi). Although only one single moment of thought arose in one thought process, the ignorance
(moha) that kept the events and experiences of these existences hidden was removed through that moment of thought. All kinds of events and experiences of these existences were remembered only after that, through subsequent
successive processes of reflection (paccavekkha&#7751;a-v&#299;thi)&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote3"><span class="tm13">3</span></a><a
 id="footnote3back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm22">, which followed the processes of super-knowledge (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-v&#299;thi).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The noble Bodhisatta who remembered the successive existences of the past through the super-knowledge of past existences (pubbe-niv&#257;s&#257;nussati-vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
also attained the super-knowledge that could assure him of the attainment of the supramundane (lokuttara) paths and fruits with penetrating insight thus: &quot;There have been only the phenomena of mind and matter (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa)
throughout the countless rounds of existence whose beginning is unknown. In all the three periods of birth, life and death, there have been only these two phenomena of mind and matter. Indeed, in all abodes and at all times,
the phenomena of mind and matter are in a constant flux of change, like the flame of a butter lamp or the flow of a river, and through the succession of causes and effects, it is only the continuum of mind and matter that
performs various functions, such as seeing forms, hearing sounds, etc., at the six doors of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, thereby thus giving rise to various modes of expression of intention (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;atti)
through bodily movement and verbal expression, etc. In reality, there is no sentient individual at all that could be called &quot;I&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, etc. Indeed, there is not a single
Deva, Mara or Brahma who could create such a sentient being.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Being thus, the Bodhisatta, through superknowledge of past existences, temporarily set aside (vikkhambhana-pah&#257;na) the twenty false views of self (atta-v&#257;da),
which are the four false views of self pertaining to the aggregates of corporeality, namely, form is self, self has form, form exists in self, self exists in form, and similarly each set of these four false views pertaining
to the remaining aggregates of feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness. In this way, he also set aside the delusion (moha) that had taken place in the distant past.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm18">2. The attainment of the super-knowledge of divine vision (dibba-cakkhu-abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;), which is the second realization (vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">After the noble Bodhisatta had attained the super-knowledge of past existences in the first watch of that night, he recalled many past events and existences by means
of that super-knowledge; and, having temporarily set aside the twenty false views (sakk&#257;ya-di&#7789;&#7789;hi) together with the delusion (moha) that had taken place in the distant past, he directed his mental continuum,
endowed with the said eight qualities, to the attainment of the knowledge of the vision of the deaths and births of beings (cut&#363;pap&#257;ta-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) and to the attainment of the knowledge of the analysis
of the deeds that lead to rebirth (yath&#257;-kamm&#363;paga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm29">Knowledge of the analysis of actions that lead to rebirth is identical with knowledge of divine vision. When knowledge of divine vision develops, knowledge of
the analysis of actions that lead to rebirth and knowledge of foreseeing the future (an&#257;gata&#7745;sa-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) also develop.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">When the mind was thus directed to the attainment of the super-knowledge of divine vision, the second insight (vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) arose quite easily.
By means of this super-knowledge he could see living beings at the threshold of death or just after conception; those who were of low or high birth, those who were beautiful or ugly, and attaining a happy existence or an unhappy
existence. In other words, he saw those who were rich and prosperous due to their past good deeds based on the absence of greed (alobha), and those who were destitute and stricken with poverty due to their past unwholesome
deeds based on greed (lobha).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">After he saw through the super-knowledge of divine vision the inhabitants of the lower realms (ap&#257;ya) suffering from misfortune, he thought: &quot;What deeds
have these beings of the lower realms committed to cause them to suffer such terrible suffering?&quot; Thereupon the super-knowledge of the analysis of deeds leading to rebirth arose in him, which enabled him to see the unwholesome
deeds committed by these beings.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Similarly, having seen through the super-knowledge of divine vision the immeasurable happiness enjoyed by living beings in the worlds of men, devas and brahmas in
an ever higher and better form, he thought: &quot;What deeds have these men, devas and brahmas performed in order to enjoy such increasing glorious bliss in their respective worlds?&quot; Thereupon the super-knowledge of analysis
of deeds leading to rebirth arose in him, which enabled him to see the good deeds performed by these beings.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">By means of the knowledge of the analysis of deeds that lead to rebirth, he examined in detail the past good and bad deeds of beings and knew them as they actually
were: &quot;These inhabitants of the lower worlds in their previous existences committed evil with body, word and mind; they slandered, insulted and blasphemed the noble (ariya). They held wrong views and with these wrong
views they themselves committed and caused others to commit various bad deeds. After death and the disintegration of their bodies, they reappeared in the lower worlds, in (ap&#257;ya), namely: in the world of continuous suffering
(av&#299;ci), in the animal world (tiracch&#257;na), in the peta world and in the asura world.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">He learned that: &quot;These beings in good existences performed good deeds with body, speech and mind; they did not slander, insult or blaspheme the noble (ariya);
they held right views and with right views performed various kinds of good deeds and induced others to do the same. After death and the disintegration of their bodies, they were reborn in the happy destinations of humans,
devas and brahmas.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">This superknowledge of divine vision, the second insight, was attained by the noble Bodhisatta at midnight on that day. By means of this second insight, the Bodhisatta&#39;s
mental continuum became free from the element of ignorance and delusion (avijj&#257;-moha-dh&#257;tu) that obscured the passing and appearing of sentient beings. Then, by means of the superknowledge of the analysis of deeds
that lead to rebirth, which has as its basis the superknowledge of divine vision, he was able to examine and comprehend the true facts of the past deeds of sentient beings; and, having eliminated the sixteen kinds of doubts
(ka&#7749;kh&#257;), the Bodhisatta attained the stage of purity through the elimination of doubts (ka&#7749;kh&#257;-vitara&#7751;a-visuddhi).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Sixteen kinds of doubts arise from thinking:<br /><br />1. Did I exist in the past?<br />2. Did I not exist in the past?<br />3. Who was I in the past?<br />4. What
was I like in the past?<br />5. From what state to what state did I pass in the past?<br />6. Will I exist in the future?<br />7. Will I not exist in the future?<br />8. Who will I be in the future?<br />9. What will I be
in the future?<br />10. From what state to what state will I pass in the future?<br />11. Do I exist?<br />12. Do I not exist?<br />13. Who am I?<br />14. What am I?<br />15. Where did this being come from?<br />16. Where
is it going?</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm12">3. Attaining knowledge of the destruction of defilements (&#257;savakkhaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), the third realization (vijj&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
and becoming a Buddha.</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The noble Bodhisatta attained knowledge of the path of the Arahant (Arahatta-magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), also called knowledge of the destruction of defilements
(&#257;savakkhaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), in the last watch of the night, thereby realizing omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Then, in order to become a Buddha among men, devas and brahmas, he directed his mind-stream, endowed with the above-mentioned eight attributes, to attain knowledge
of the path of an Arahant; then, letting it abide in the doctrine of dependent origination (pa&#7789;icca-samupp&#257;da), consisting of twelve factors: ignorance (avijj&#257;), volitional formations of the mind (sa&#7749;kh&#257;ra),
consciousness (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), mind and matter (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa), the six sense spheres (sa&#7735;&#257;yatana), contact (phassa), feeling (vedan&#257;), craving (ta&#7751;h&#257;), attachment (up&#257;d&#257;na),
becoming (bhava), birth (j&#257;ti), old age (jar&#257;) and death (mara&#7751;a). By repeatedly considering this doctrine of dependent origination in the forward and backward order, he attained the noble path (ariya-magga),
which is also known as knowing and seeing things as they actually are (yath&#257;-bh&#363;ta-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana).<br /><br />This knowledge of the four paths (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) did not appear in the
mindstream of beings like Sakka and Brahma, who were very powerful in the world, and noble ascetics like Kaladevila and Narada, who had achieved great mastery in the jh&#257;nas and supernormal faculties (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;).
Therefore, the question may arise: &#8220;Why did this knowledge of the four paths, so subtle and profound, undreamed of throughout beginningless Samsara, and never before realized, appear in the mindstream of the Bodhisatta,
who had no teacher and who entered upon the path of asceticism of his own free will?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The noble Bodhisatta, over the course of four immeasurable periods and 100,000 world-aeons, passed through existences so numerous that they could not be counted in
hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands, and he accumulated the meritorious deeds of the perfection of generosity (d&#257;na-p&#257;ram&#299;), which were performed on the basis of the four modes of development, even
at the risk of his own life. And in each existence, he behaved in such a way as to completely eradicate or reduce the defilement of greed that arose whenever he paid attention to an object. This brought him to the stage where
others began to remark, &#8220;Is there no defilement of greed in the mental continuum of this noble person?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">In the same way, by virtue of the perfections of morality, patience and goodwill, which were developed throughout the period of four immeasurable periods and 100,000
aeons, he prevented the arising of anger, and by developing goodwill over a long period, he extinguished the fires of anger and also got rid of their accompanying envy (iss&#257;), stinginess (macchariya) and regret (kukkucca).</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">By means of the perfection of wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;-p&#257;ram&#299;), which was well developed and accumulated over many existences and eons, he dispelled
the element of darkness, which is delusion (moha). He also abandoned wrong views and thus became a great man with very pure wisdom. He also approached all the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples, as well as other learned
men whom he had met, and asked them questions such as: &quot;Which Dhamma is faulty and which Dhamma is blameless? Which Dhamma is polluted and which Dhamma is pure?&quot; By asking such questions, he removed doubts in matters
of Dhamma and developed wisdom, existence after existence.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">In the house of his relatives he showed respect to elders such as his mother and father, maternal uncles and others by bowing, paying homage, paying honours, offering
seats, rising from his seat in advance and greeting them. He also showed respect to learned men of virtuous conduct. By this means he removed vanity (m&#257;na) and worry (uddhacca) and became free from arrogance, like a snake
with broken teeth, or a bull with broken horns, or a rope mat for wiping feet. He used to praise the virtues of patience, the virtue of desiring the welfare of others and the virtue of helping others with compassion.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Having renounced the world, the Bodhisatta gave up the luxury of his domain and kingdom and became a hermit. After attaining the jhanas in the forest, he abandoned
the five hindrances and got rid of sensual attraction (k&#257;ma-r&#257;ga). With the perfection of truthfulness, he also abstained from false speech (micch&#257;-vaca), which tends to mislead the world; with the perfection
of energy, he also eliminated dissatisfaction (arati) and sloth (kosajja) in the practices of concentration and insight, which are practices of extraordinary merit, keeping his mind constantly active and diligent in performing
good deeds. In the above manner, he strove to make his mental stream purer and purer, one existence after another.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">The noble Bodhisatta who thus eliminated the moral defilements (kilesa) through the accumulated merits still had to go through the process of repeated purification,
even in a single existence, because the defilements eliminated soon reappeared. He then eliminated them, only to find that they reappeared because they had not yet been completely eradicated (samuccheda-pah&#257;na) through
knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a). However, the Bodhisatta did not admit defeat and give up, but temporarily pushed them aside at a distance (tad-a&#7749;ga-pah&#257;na) and through suppression (vikkhambhana-pah&#257;na)
through deeds of great merit (mah&#257;-kusala).<br /><br /></span><em><span class="tm29">The following notes, based on Ledi Sayadaw&#8217;s Manual of Insight (Vipassan&#257;-dipan&#299;), are given here to further clarify
this paragraph. Moral defilements arise in ordinary laymen in three stages: When the defilements are very active and strong, producing evil deeds (v&#299;tikkama-bh&#363;mi). The defilements of this stage can be got rid of
or removed by good deeds of perfect morality, but only temporarily. Therefore removal by morality, etc., is called temporary removal (tad-a&#7749;ga-pah&#257;na).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm29">The defilements in the next stage arise as mental properties at the gates of the mind when any object with the power to arouse them produces disturbances at one
of the six gates (pariyu&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na-bh&#363;mi). The defilements that arise in this way can only be suppressed by cultivating the jh&#257;nas through the practice of concentration. The removal of defilements through
concentration (sam&#257;dhi) is called withdrawal (vikkhambhana-pah&#257;na). The jh&#257;nas can remove the defilements for a considerable time so that they do not arise again.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm29">But there still remain the defilements of the third stage, which do not arise as mental qualities but lie latent, surrounding the life continuum (anusaya-bh&#363;mi).
They cannot be eliminated by morality and concentration and remain uneliminated by them. Only knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), achieved by developing insight meditation that produces wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;),
can rid oneself of these defilements without leaving anything behind. This elimination of defilements by wisdom, so that they never arise again, is called abandonment by cutting off (samuccheda-pah&#257;na).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm29">Here the accomplishment of the perfections and the practice of morality, which temporarily remove the defilements (tad-a&#7749;ga-pah&#257;na), are referred to
as great deeds of merit (mah&#257;-kusala); the practice of concentration meditation for the development of concentration, which removes the defilements, is regarded as a super-deed of merit (mah&#257;ggata-kusala). The practice
of insight meditation for the arising of wisdom, knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which completely cuts off by abandonment (samuccheda-pah&#257;na), is a supramundane deed of merit (lokuttara-kusala).</span></em></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Thus, over a period of four immeasurable periods and 100,000 eons, he rooted out the aggregates of impurities that polluted his mind, and also eliminated ignorance
and delusion (avijj&#257;-moha), which act like a general of an army leading the hordes of defilements (kilesa) that accompany him. At the same time, he strengthened the five powers: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration,
and wisdom, existence after existence. Thus he passed through the arduous journey of Sams&#257;ra, continually engaged in the development and fulfillment of the perfections (p&#257;ram&#299;) with ardent zeal until the time
when, as King Vessantara, he gave away Queen Madd&#299; in generosity as the final act of merit that would enable him to become a Buddha. After this, he spent his life in the world of Tusita, enjoying heavenly pleasures and
awaiting the time when he would become a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Because he was one who had thus attained the pinnacle of wisdom, having eliminated the factors of defilements such as greed, hatred, and others, through the accumulated
merits of perfections such as generosity, morality, and others, the fourfold knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which is very profound and subtle, arose spontaneously in the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Moreover, from the time he prostrated himself at the feet of the Buddha D&#299;pa&#7749;kara, he strove to develop and accumulate merit through the accomplishment
of the perfections that are difficult for ordinary people to accomplish, without making any wishes for the pleasures of any realm of existence as the fruits of his good deeds. For all the meritorious deeds such as generosity,
morality, and others that he performed, the Bodhisatta made only this wish: &quot;May the accumulated merits of these deeds become sufficient conditions (upanissaya-paccaya) for the arising of omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
in me.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">As for others, they desire the pleasures of the deva and human realms after performing good deeds. And in accordance with their desires, they receive the pleasures
of the deva and human realms as the fruits of their good deeds. This is like spending and dissipating all the wealth of merit they have accumulated from their good deeds. In contrast to these people, the Bodhisatta, like one
who fills his granary with rice and always guards it without using it, rightly preserves the merit acquired from each performance of his good deeds, wishing: &quot;May this action alone be a sufficient condition for the realization
of knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) with omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) as its summit.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">In this state of affairs, the accumulation of merits from perfections and good deeds over a long period of four immeasurable periods and 100,000 eons had found occasion
to bear fruit, of which his becoming a Buddha was the greatest in this last existence as Siddhattha. But since there were countless merits that had yet to bear fruit all in one existence, this existence itself seemed to be
overflowing with fruitful merits. Therefore only one such being can be supported by the world sphere.</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm21"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm13">Because of the aspiration solely for becoming a Buddha, the merits of his good deeds, which were to bear fruit in a great stream in this last existence, were very
powerful. Consequently, only in the mind-stream of the noble Bodhisattva did the knowledge of the four paths, which are so subtle and profound, arise spontaneously.</span></p>

 class="tm31">&nbsp;&nbsp;Five kinds of mastery (vas&#299;-bh&#257;va) or five kinds of control over the jh&#257;nas are mentioned in the Visuddhimagga and include:</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm31">1. &#257;vajjana-vas&#299; - skill in directing the mind to jhana 2. sam&#257;pajjana-vas&#299; - skill in entering jhana 3. adhi&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na-vas&#299;
- skill in remaining in jhana 4. vu&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na-vas&#299; - skill in exiting jhana 5. paccavekkha&#7751;a-vas&#299; - skill in observing the factors of jhana.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm31">These are the five aspects of full mastery of the jhanas, which enable the practitioner to enter, remain in, and emerge from jhana at will, and to analyze the experience
of jhana after emerging from it.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"><a id="footnote2"></a></span><u><sup><a href="#footnote2back"><span class="tm31">2</span></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm31">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mudut&#257; (softness, pliability) and kamma&ntilde;&ntilde;at&#257; (plasticity, workability, controllability) are part of the wholesome mental factors (sobhana cetasika). They are described in the
Abhidhamma as the opposites of rigidity and inflexibility of the mind.</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm31">These qualities are compared to well-processed leather or refined gold, which can be easily shaped. Similarly, when the mind has these qualities:</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm31">Easily directed to objects of meditation. Reacts flexibly to changes in conditions. Works effectively with various meditative tasks. Obedient to the will of the practitioner.
These qualities are especially important for deep meditation and the attainment of jhanas, as they allow the mind to be sufficiently flexible and pliable.</span></p>
<p class="tm33"><span class="tm9"><a id="footnote3"></a></span><u><sup><a href="#footnote3back"><span class="tm31">3</span></a></sup></u><span
 class="tm31">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Abhidhamma, paccavekkha&#7751;a-v&#299;thi is described as a special type of mental process that follows moments of attainment (as in the case of jh&#257;nas or psychic powers) or after the
attainment of path and fruition (magga-phala). This process enables the mind to fully comprehend, analyze, and integrate the experience or knowledge it has received, making it available for subsequent reflection and application.</span></p>
