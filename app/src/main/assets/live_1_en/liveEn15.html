<p class="tm16"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm19">Offering of milk rice</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">When the dawn of the full moon day broke, he purified his body and left that place, and when he reached the banyan tree which Suj&#257;t&#257;, the daughter of a
rich man, visited annually for worship, he stopped and sat at the base of the tree, facing the east, waiting for the time to collect alms. At this, the entire banyan tree brightly reflected the light from his bodily effulgence.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">At that time, in the market town of Sen&#257;gama, in the district of Uruvela, Sujata, the daughter of a rich man named Sen&#257;n&#299;, having attained her majority,
prayed at the foot of a banyan tree thus:</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">&quot;Guardian maiden of the banyan tree, if I marry into a rich family of the same caste, I will honor you with an offering of thick milk rice.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Sujata&#39;s prayer was fulfilled. As a result, every year on the full moon day of the month of Ves&#257;kha, she offered thick milk rice to the guardian maiden of
the banyan tree.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm21">When reading the story of Sujata&#39;s offering of milk-rice, readers are generally inclined to think, if not to be careful, that Sujata first made the offering
of milk-rice to the guardian maiden of the banyan tree in gratitude for the fulfillment of her prayer on that very full-moon day of the month of Ves&#257;kha when the Bodhisatta was to attain Buddhahood.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm21">In fact, her prayer was fulfilled and the guardian maiden of the banyan tree had been receiving offerings of thick milk rice for about 20 years prior to that
day, since the son of Sujata in question was, in fact, a wealthy young man named Yasa. In the year in which the Buddha was to appear, Yasa was already a married man enjoying the luxuries of a wealthy family. Considering this
fact, it is worth noting that Sujata had been making offerings of thick milk rice to the guardian maiden of the banyan tree every year on the full moon day of the month of Vesakha for the past 20 years after her prayer for
her firstborn was fulfilled.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The preparations made by Sujata for the offering to the guardian maiden of the banyan tree on that full moon day of the month of Vesakha when the Bodhisatta completed
six years of ascetic practice were as follows:</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">First, she allowed the dairy cows to graze in the licorice grove. Then the milk from these cows was fed to other cows, then to the next, and so on six times. And
finally, the milk from the last cows was fed to another eight cows.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">So Sujata applied this step by step milk transfer process to get thick, tasty and nutritious cow&#39;s milk for making milk rice.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">With the intention, &quot;I will make a sacrificial offering of thick milk rice early today,&quot; Sujata rose early in the morning on the full moon day of the month
of Ves&#257;kha and milked the above-mentioned milch cows. The calves, without the need of being tied with a rope, did not come near the udders of their mother cows. The wonderful thing was that when a milk bowl was placed
under the udders, the milk flowed continuously and profusely of its own accord, without the need of milking. Sujata, seeing this miraculous event, personally collected the flowing milk and poured it into a new pot, and she
herself lit a fire to cook the thick milk rice.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">When the thick milk-rice was being cooked, foam appeared in great quantity, rotating clockwise, but not a single drop spilled; no smoke rose from the fire at all;
the Four Great Kings, the guardians of the world, stood in front of the fire; the Great Brahma provided an umbrella to cover the pot of thick milk-rice; Sakka kept the fire going, and with their supernatural powers the devas
collected the nutrients that were fit for the devas and men living on the four continents. They did this as if they were collecting honey from a honeycomb hanging on the branches. Then they mixed the nutrients thus collected
with the thick milk-rice.<br /><br /></span><em><span class="tm21">As the commentary notes:<br />At other times the devas added the above-mentioned nutrients, fit for the devas and men, to each morsel of food as the Buddha
prepared to put it into his mouth. However, on two special occasions, the day the Bodhisattva became Buddha and the day he entered Parinibbana, the devas added these nutrients to the bowl.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Having seen many wonderful phenomena one day in the place where thick milk rice was being prepared, Sujata called a maidservant named Pu&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; and
ordered her thus: &quot;Dear Pu&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;, today our guardian maiden of the banyan tree seems to be in a good mood. In the last 20 years I have never seen such wonderful things. Hurry, go and cleanse the banyan
tree, the abode of the guardian maiden.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The maid hurried and, arriving at the banyan tree, saw the Bodhisatta sitting at its foot facing east, and the entire tree shining with a golden-yellow light from
the radiation emanating from the Bodhisatta&#39;s body. Frightened and thinking, &quot;Today the guardian maiden of the banyan tree has come down from the tree. It seems to me that he is sitting there to receive the offering
with his own hands,&quot; she hurriedly returned home and reported this to Sujata.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Hearing the maidservant&#39;s words, Sujata became very happy and said, &quot;From today onwards, be my eldest daughter,&quot; and gifted her with all the clothes
and ornaments befitting a daughter.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">It is the natural law (dhammat&#257;) for a Bodhisatta to receive an offering of thick milk rice porridge on the day of attaining Buddhahood; and it is proper to
receive this food only in a golden bowl.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Sujata, intending, &quot;I will put the thick milk rice porridge in the golden bowl,&quot; took out a precious bowl from her chambers. Then she poured the thick milk
rice porridge she had prepared into it by tilting the pot. After that, all the milk rice porridge flowed into the bowl to the last drop, like drops of water sliding on a lotus leaf. All the porridge filled the bowl exactly
to the brim, no more and no less.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Sujata covered the golden bowl with a golden lid and wrapped it in a pure white cloth. Then, having adorned herself in full attire and carrying the bowl on her head,
she went to the banyan tree. She was overwhelmed with joy at seeing the Bodhisatta and, taking him for the guardian deva of the banyan tree, she approached him respectfully. Then she removed the golden bowl from her head,
opened it and, taking the pitcher of water, went to the Bodhisatta and stood next to him.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The clay alms bowls that had been offered to the Bodhisatta by Brahma Gha&#7789;&#299;k&#257;ra during his renunciation and that had remained with him throughout
his six years of severe austerity, inexplicably disappeared just as Sujata came to offer alms. Not seeing the bowl, the Bodhisatta extended his right hand to receive water. Sujata offered the alms in a golden bowl, placing
it in the Bodhisatta&#39;s hands. He looked at Sujata, who, perfectly understanding the Bodhisatta&#39;s gaze, addressed him: &quot;Venerable sir, I have offered you milk-rice gruel in this golden bowl; accept it along with
the bowl.&quot; Then, uttering the prayerful words: &quot;My heart&#39;s desire has been fulfilled. May your heart&#39;s desire also be fulfilled,&quot; she departed, showing no concern for the golden bowl worth 100,000, as
if it were a withered leaf.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The Bodhisatta also rose from his seat and, going round the banyan tree, went to the bank of the Neranjara River, carrying with him a golden bowl of thick milky rice
porridge. On the Neranjara River there was a bathing place called Suppati&#7789;&#7789;hita, where many Bodhisattas went down and washed themselves on the day they were to become Buddhas. The Bodhisatta left the bowl at the
bathing place and, having washed himself, rose and sat facing east in the cool shade of the tree. He then prepared exactly 49 pieces of porridge, each about the size of a ripe palmyra seed. This thick milk rice porridge, in
the form of 49 pieces, served as food (&#257;h&#257;ra) to fully sustain him for the 49 days (satta-satt&#257;ha) that he stayed near the Bodhi tree after becoming the Buddha. During these 49 days, the Buddha spent his time
absorbed in the peace of the jh&#257;nas and the fruits of enlightenment, without taking any other food, without performing ablutions, without washing his face, or without purifying his body and limbs.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">After eating the alms offered by Sujata, the Bodhisatta, holding the lid of the golden bowl, made this resolution: &quot;If I become a Buddha today, let this golden
bowl float against the current; if I do not become a Buddha today, let it float downstream.&quot; He then set it afloat in the Neranjara River. The golden bowl crossed the current and went straight to the middle of the river,
and then floated from there against the current at the speed of a fast-running horse for about 80 cubits and sank into a whirlpool. Reaching the palace of the Naga King Kala, it struck all three golden bowls used by the three
previous Buddhas, namely Kakusandha, Ko&#7751;&#257;gamana and Kassapa, on the day they were to attain Buddhahood, making a metallic sound and came to rest above the three golden bowls.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Hearing this sound, the Naga King K&#257;&#7735;a said, &quot;Only yesterday a Buddha appeared; today another Buddha appears,&quot; and then he stood up, uttering
words of praise in many verses.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm21">The period of time between the appearance of Buddha Kassapa and our Buddha was so long that during that time the great earth rose one league and three miles.
But for the Naga King K&#257;&#7735;a this time was so short that he could speak of these appearances as occurring &quot;yesterday and today.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The Bodhisatta then rested for a day in the S&#257;la grove, on the bank of the Nera&ntilde;jar&#257;, which was filled with very fragrant flowers and greenery and
was pleasing to all. He then began to practice breathing meditation. After attaining the eight worldly absorptions (jh&#257;na) and the five super-knowledges (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;), at dusk, in the cool of the evening,
he walked along the path adorned with Devas and Brahmas to the Nera&ntilde;jar&#257; and, after bathing, went to the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree along the same path. After this, the N&#257;gas, Yakkhas and Gandhabbas paid homage
to him with offerings of celestial flowers, incense and savour. Then the entire 10,000 world&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote1"><span
 class="tm14">1</span></a><a id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm20">&nbsp;was almost covered with heavenly flowers and incense, and the delight of the Devas and Brahmas.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm16"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm19">Sotthiya gives sacred grass</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm16"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm16"><span class="tm9"></span>

<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">At that time, Sotthiya, a brahmin mower, was coming from the opposite direction, carrying grass. Sensing the Bodhisatta&#39;s desire for some grass, he offered him
eight armfuls of grass. The Bodhisatta, carrying eight armfuls of grass, climbed to the heights of the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree and stood to the south of it, facing north. At that moment, the southern part of the 10,000 worlds
sank so low that it seemed as if it would touch Mah&#257; Av&#299;ci&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote2"><span class="tm14">2</span></a><a
 id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm20">; and the northern part of the 10,000 world rose so high that it seemed as if it would fly up and reach the heavenly world.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Seeing this phenomenon, the Bodhisatta thought, &quot;This is not the place where one can realize knowledge of the Arhat&#39;s path (Arahatta-magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
and omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),&quot; and so, having walked clockwise around the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree, he went to the west of the tree and stood there facing the east. At that moment,
the western part of the world sank so much that it seemed as if it would touch Mah&#257; Av&#299;ci, and the eastern part rose so much that it seemed as if it would fly up to Bhavagga.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Seeing this phenomenon, the Bodhisatta again thought, &#8220;This is not the place where one can realize the knowledge of the Arhat&#8217;s path and omniscience,&#8221;
and so, having walked clockwise around the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree, he turned north and stood there facing south. At that moment, the northern part of the world sank so much that it seemed as if it would touch Mah&#257; Av&#299;ci;
and the southern part rose so much that it seemed as if it would fly up and reach Bhavagga&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote3"><span

<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm21">The position of the great earth in the places to the south, west and north where the noble Bodhisatta stood was such that it sank behind him and rose before him,
like a cart wheel lying flat on its central hub on the ground, which rocks or tilts when treaded on at the edge.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Seeing this phenomenon, the Bodhisatta again thought, &#8220;This is also not the place where one can realize the knowledge of the Arhat path and omniscience,&#8221;
and so, after circling the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree clockwise, he headed east and stood facing west.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm21">On this point, the commentary to the Chronicles of the Buddhas (Buddha-va&#7745;sa) only mentions the following: &quot;The noble Bodhisatta approached the Bodhi
tree, and, having circled it three times, stood at the north-eastern corner, scattering eight bundles of grass.&quot; There is no mention of the fact that the great earth tilted to one side when he stood in the south, west
and north. However, in the Ornaments of the Conqueror (Jin&#257;la&#7749;k&#257;ra)&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote4"><span
 class="tm14">4</span></a><a id="footnote4back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm22">It is said: &quot;When the Bodhisatta stood in the south, west and north, the great earth trembled like a drop of water
falling on a lotus leaf,&quot; and that, standing in the north-east corner, he scattered eight handfuls of grass.</span></em></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The place where the invincible (apar&#257;jita) throne was to appear to the east of the Mah&#257; Bodhi tree stood firm and unshakable, being the place that cannot
be abandoned (avijahita&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na) where the thrones of all the Buddhas appeared. Knowing, &quot;This place is certainly the auspicious place of victory where all the Buddhas destroy the obscurations,&quot; the
noble Bodhisatta scattered the eight bundles of grass he had brought.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">The moment he scattered the grass, it turned into a large throne.</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">With the Mahabodhi tree as his background, facing east and with an unwavering mind, the Bodhisatta expressed his determination&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote5"><span class="tm14">5</span></a><a id="footnote5back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm20">: &quot;Let only the skin remain, let only the sinews remain, let only the bones remain, let
my whole body, all the flesh and blood dry up, but if I do not attain Enlightenment, I will in no way change the cross-legged posture I have now adopted.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm11"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm20">Thus, developing the firm determination of the four factors, he sat on the jewel throne, adopting the invincible (apar&#257;jita) cross-legged posture, a posture
for subduing enemies, not for admitting defeat, which cannot be destroyed even if hundreds of thunderbolts strike it simultaneously.</span></p>

>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adhi&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na (adh&#299;t&#7789;h&#257;na) is a firm determination or unwavering intention. It is one of the ten perfections (p&#257;r&#257;mi) in the Buddhist tradition.</span></p>
<p class="tm25"><span class="tm9">In a practical sense, adhitthana means making a firm decision to perform a certain practice or follow a certain commitment for a set period of time. For example, the determination to meditate
every day for a certain period of time or to observe certain rules of conduct.</span></p>
