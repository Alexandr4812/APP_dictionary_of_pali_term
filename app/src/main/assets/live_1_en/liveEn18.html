<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Having eliminated the factors of defilements such as greed, hatred and the like, through the merits accumulated through the cultivation of the pairs such as generosity,
morality and the like, the Bodhisatta, who had also eliminated delusion (moha), which is the leader of all defilements, together with its attendant factors that tend to obstruct and conceal the path to Nibbana, then practiced
and developed the great indestructible insight (maha-vajira-vipassana) in the last watch of the night, on the full moon of the month of Vesak.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">A brief description of the method of practice and development is as follows: There are 1000 billion world systems known as the sphere of influence (ana-khetta) of
the Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">The sphere of influence of the Buddha: According to the subcommentary to (Jinalankara) and the commentary to the Vinaya Parajika, there are three spheres (khetta)
associated with the Buddha:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">1) The birth sphere (jati-khetta), limited by 10,000 world systems, which shook when the Blessed One was born on Earth.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">2) The sphere of influence (ana-khetta), limited to 1000 billion world systems, where the following protective suttas (paritta) are effective:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">Paritta on the Jewels (Ratana Sutta).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">Paritta Sutta on the Aggregates (Khandha-paritta).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">Paritta Sutta on the Banner (Dhajagga-paritta).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">Paritta sutta Atanatiya (Atanatiya-paritta).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">Paritta Sutta on the Peacock (Mora-paritta);<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm23">3) The scope (visaya-khetta) is limitless and immeasurable, in it the Buddha&#39;s knowledge can manifest omniscience (sabbannuta-nyana), cognizing anything and anywhere
at his will.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When the Bodhisatta contemplated the true nature of the beings living in each world system, he fully realized that no matter how many humans, Devas and Brahmas there
are in one world system, they can be reduced to the twelve factors of dependent origination (paticca-samuppada) as the ultimate reality:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Past factors as a cause:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">ignorance (avija)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">volitional formations of the mind (sankhara)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The real factors as a consequence:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">consciousness (vinnana)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">psychophysical phenomena (nama-rupa)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">six sense spheres (salayatana)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">contact (phassa)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">feeling (vedana)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Real factors as a cause:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">thirst (tanha)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">clinging (upadana)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">existence (kamma-bhava)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Future factors as a consequence:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">birth (jati)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">old age (jara)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">death (marana)</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When he contemplated the true nature of the human beings, Devas and Brahmas living in the other world systems and belonging to the three periods of time, he fully
realized that, as in the case of the beings of this system, the same twelve factors of dependent origination are objects of insight (vipassana), beginning with ignorance and ending with birth, old age and death.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">To sum up the number of objects of insight, we can say that since there are 1,000 billion world systems, there are also 1,000 billion of each of the twelve factors.
The total number of these objects then becomes 1,200,000 billion.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Just as a man, in cutting and clearing a dense jungle with tangled brush and undergrowth, sharpens his machete again and again, so the Bodhisatta, in order to clear
away the dense jungle and thickets of defilements (kilesas), numbering 1,500, repeatedly sharpened the blade of the sword of great insight knowledge (maha-vajira-vipassana-&ntilde;ana), his personal weapon, on the whetstone
of the fourth jhana of mindfulness of breathing (anapana-jhana). Then he contemplated each of the factors of dependent origination, numbering 1,200,000 billion, reflecting on their characteristics of impermanence (anicca-lakkhana),
suffering (dukkha-lakkhana), and impersonality (anatta-lakkhana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Because each of the factors of dependent origination, numbering 1,200,000 billion, gives rise to the three kinds of insight knowledge: insight knowledge of impermanence
(anicca-vipassana-&ntilde;ana), insight knowledge of suffering (dukkha-vipassana-&ntilde;ana), and insight knowledge of impersonality (anatta-vipassana-&ntilde;ana), a total of 3,600,000 billion great insight knowledges have
arisen.&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote1"><span class="tm22">1</span></a><a id="footnote1back"></a></sup></u></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">The usual practice of every Bodhisattva on the eve of becoming a Buddha is to contemplate the teaching of dependent origination in both the forward and reverse order. Our Bodhisattva, like
previous Bodhisattvas, also contemplated the teaching of dependent origination in both orders. After this, all 10,000 world systems that make up the birth sphere (jati-khetta) shook, and the effect of this reached the limits
of the adjacent world oceans.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">After the Bodhisatta had developed the knowledge of insight in groups (sammasana-&ntilde;ana), he entered the fourth jhana of mindfulness of breathing (anapana-jhana). This was done in order
to sharpen the higher knowledge of insight (vipassana-&ntilde;ana), in particular the knowledge of the arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;ana) of the five aggregates, using the fourth jhana as a basis. Emerging from
this state of concentration, he easily realized the higher knowledge of insight.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">It should be noted that the Bodhisatta realized the highest insight knowledges with ease because, in the past, he had been a monk many times, in the presence of past Buddhas, he had studied
the Three Baskets and practiced insight meditation, cultivating and developing it until he had attained such knowledges as:<br /><br />Arising and Passing Away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;ana)<br />Disappearance (bhanga-&ntilde;ana)<br />Knowledge
of Fear (bhaya-&ntilde;ana)<br />Danger (adinava-&ntilde;ana)<br />Disappointment (nibbida-&ntilde;ana)<br />The Desire for Liberation (muccitukamyata-&ntilde;ana)<br />Reconsideration (patisankha-&ntilde;ana)<br />Equanimity
with Formations (sankharupekkha-&ntilde;ana)<br /><br />This was also because his insight knowledge had greatly developed and grown due to the above-mentioned 3,600,000 billion great knowledges of understanding the groups
of conditioned things. (maha-vajira-vipassana-sammasana-nana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Just as a person, having reached the threshold of his home after a long journey, does not stop at the threshold but immediately enters the house by opening the door, so the noble Bodhisatta,
having easily realized ever higher knowledges of insight, successively passing through a series of eight stages of knowledge without any delay, finally reached the last stages - the knowledge of reconciliation or adaptation
(anuloma-nyana), and did not stop there. Instead of stopping at the knowledge of agreement with the truth (saccanuloma-&ntilde;ana), which is like the gate to the city of Nibbana, he immediately proceeded to dispel the darkness
of ignorance and delusion (avijja-moha) that obscure the four truths, namely:<br /><br />The truth of suffering (dukkha-sacca)<br />The truth of the origin of suffering<br />(samudaya-sacca) The truth of the cessation of suffering
(nirodha-sacca)<br />The truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (magga-sacca)<br /><br />By means of the three types of agreement with the truth (saccanuloma-&ntilde;ana):<br /><br />Preliminary impulse (parikamma)<br />Access
impulse (upacara)<br />Adaptation (anuloma)<br /><br />Which are involved in the process of the mind of the path (magga-vithi).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Having thus dispelled the thick darkness that concealed the truth, he saw clearly as one sees the moon in a cloudless sky, and realized the great light of Nibbana through the knowledge of
Stream-Entry (Sotapatti-magga-nana), which immediately follows the knowledge of the overcoming of worldly bonds, passing on to the knowledge of the change of origin (gotrabhu-nana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">The moment of knowledge of the path of Stream-Entry (Sotapatti-magga-&ntilde;ana) arose once and ceased. This was immediately followed by the arising and ceasing of the three impulses (javana)
to the fruit of Stream-Entry (Sotapatti-phala), which is the result of the said path of Stream-Entry, in accordance with the attribute of Dhamma known as immediate fruit (akalika), then followed the stream of consciousness
of the life continuum (bhavanga-citta).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Since the path of Stream-Entry has been achieved, the Bodhisatta&#39;s mind is completely freed from the three defilements:<br />View of personality (sakkaya-ditthi)<br />Doubt (vicikiccha)<br />Attachment
to rituals and rules (silabbata-paramasa)<br /><br />These defilements will never again arise in the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">Doubt or hesitation (vicikicchha) of the mind regarding:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">1) Buddhas;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">2) Dhammas;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">3) Sangha;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">4) rules of teaching (sikkha);</span></p>

<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">7) both past and future;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">8) Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">Attachment to rituals and rules (silabbata-paramasa) is the false belief that there are paths other than the Noble Eightfold Path that can liberate one from suffering (dukkha).<br />That
is, it is the mistaken idea that merely mechanically performing rituals and ceremonies can lead to liberation. It is one of the ten fetters (sanyojana) that keep beings in samsara.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">However, it is important to understand:<br />This does not mean that Buddhist practices such as puja, vandana or offerings are useless. They are important as:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">Paying homage to the Three Jewels, which develops good qualities of mind. Accumulating merit (punya), developing devotion and faith (saddha).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">The problem arises when a person believes that rituals alone can lead to Nibbana and performs practices mechanically, without understanding their true meaning, and also believes that there
are paths to liberation other than the Noble Eightfold Path.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm25">Therefore, the correct approach is to perform traditional practices with an understanding of their place in the overall context of the Path, not attaching to them as an end in themselves,
but using them as a tool or skillful means for developing the mind.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm15"><strong><span class="tm21">Awakening</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">After realizing the path of Stream Entry and its fruit, the Bodhisatta reconsidered:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">1) The Path of Stream Entry (Sotapatti-magga);</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">2) The Fruit of Stream Entry (Sotapatti-phala), which was the result of the path;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">3) Nibbana, which was their object;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">4) Impurities destroyed through the path of Stream Entry;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">5) Pollution that has not yet been eliminated by the indicated route.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">This five-fold knowledge is known as the five-fold knowledge of revision (pacchavekkhana-nyana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Having thus considered the fivefold knowledge of revision, the Bodhisatta again cultivated and developed a series of insights (vipassana-&ntilde;ana), such as the knowledge of arising and
passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;ana) and so on.<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Soon he realized the second stage of the path of One Return (Sakadagami-magga) and the fruit of One Return (Sakadagami-phala).<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Through the path of One Return he weakened the grosser defilements, namely sensual desires (kama-raga) and ill will (vyapada).</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Having realized the path and the fruit of the One-return, the Bodhisatta, with the arising in him of the impulse consciousnesses (javana-vara) of the fivefold knowledge of review (pacchavekkhana-&ntilde;ana),
contemplated the path of Non-return (Anagami-magga) and the fruit of Non-return (Anagami-phala), their object being Nibbana, the already destroyed defilements and the remaining defilements. Again he developed a series of insights
(vipassana-&ntilde;ana), such as the knowledge of arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;ana) and so on. Soon he realized the third stage of the path of Non-return and the fruit of Non-return.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Through the path of Non-Return, he completely abandoned the subtle defilements of sensual desires and ill will. From that moment on, the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum became completely
free of both the past tendencies that linger in the mind (vasana) and the hidden elements of the subtle defilements of sensual desires and ill will.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Having realized the path and fruit of Non-Return, the Bodhisatta, with the arising in him of the impulse consciousnesses (javana-vara) of the five knowledges of revision (pacchavekkhana-nyana),
contemplated the path and fruit of Non-Return, their object Nibbana, the destroyed defilements and the remaining defilements.</span></p>
<p class="tm20">&#160;</p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Again he developed a series of insights such as knowledge of arising and passing away, and so on. Soon he realized the fourth stage of the Arahant path (Arahatta-magga) and the fruit of Arahant
(Arahatta-phala).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">Through the path of the Arahant, the Bodhisatta completely eradicated all remaining defilements, namely:<br /><br />Craving for existence in the form world (rupa-raga)<br />Craving for existence
in the formless world (arupa-raga)<br />Pride (mana)<br />Worry (uddhacca)<br />Ignorance (avijja)</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm22">He left no trace of the tendencies of the past. From that moment on, the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum was completely freed from the 1,500 defilements along with the tendencies of the
past (vasana) and the seven kinds of latent tendencies (anusaya&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a href="#footnote2"><span class="tm22">2</span></a><a
 id="footnote2back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm22">).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Having realized the path of the Arahant (Arahatta-magga) and the fruits, the impulse consciousnesses (javana-vara) of the knowledge of revision (pacchavekkhana) arose,
which reflected the path and fruits of the Arahant, their object - Nibbana, and the eradicated defilements.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">There are nineteen knowledges of review in all: five each arising after the attainment of the path and fruit of Stream-Entry, the path and fruit of One-Return, and
the path and fruit of Non-Return, and four arising after the attainment of the path and fruit of Arahant. These nineteen knowledges of review are also known as insight and knowledge of liberation (vimutti-nyana-dassana). After
attaining the path of Arahant, there are no defilements remaining, and so there is no reflection on them; therefore, after attaining the path and fruit of Arahant, there are only four knowledges of review.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When the Bodhisatta realized the fruit of Arahant immediately after realizing the path of Arahant, his mental stream became extremely clear, and he attained the state
of the Completely Self-Awakened One (Samma-sambuddha), the Lord of the Three Worlds, having acquired omniscience (sabbannuta-nyana) together with the Four Noble Truths, the four analytical knowledges&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a

<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">The Seven Purifications of Buddha</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Further, the author proposes to include in this chronicle a brief description of the seven purifications (visuddhi) of the Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">1. Purity of morality (s&#299;la-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;When the Bodhisatta stopped on the bank of the river Anoma and donned the robes of a hermit, he began to observe moral restraint (sa&#7745;vara-s&#299;la).<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">The practice of the moral precepts (s&#299;la) varies according to the way of life the disciple has chosen, monastic or lay.<br />The suttas give detailed explanations
of the practice of the moral precepts, the kind of moral training that must necessarily precede meditation.<br />The Visuddhimagga (Path of Purification) explains moral training in general under four headings:<br />1) Self-restraint
according to the monastic precepts (P&#257;&#7789;imokkha-sa&#7745;vara);<br />2) Self-restraint of the sense organs (indriya-sa&#7745;vara);<br />3) Purity of the means of livelihood (&#257;jiva-p&#257;risuddhi);<br />4)
Proper use of the monastic utensils (chatthu-parisuddhi).<br />Self-restraint according to the monastic precepts is intended to be observed by the monks who are disciples of the Buddha; therefore, it is not mentioned in this
description of the Bodhisatta&#39;s purity of morality.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Moral restraint is the eight precepts (rules of moral training) with Right Livelihood as the eighth (&#257;j&#299;va&#7789;&#7789;hamaka-s&#299;la):<br /><br />Abstaining
from killing;<br />Abstaining from stealing or taking what has not been given by the owner either by deed or word;<br />Abstaining from sexual misconduct, or abstaining from inappropriate sexual activities, whether serious
or minor;<br />Abstaining from lying;<br />Abstaining from slanderous talk;<br />Abstaining from harsh and offensive speech;<br />Abstaining from idle and useless chatter;<br />Abstaining from wrong livelihood.<br /><br />By
observing these precepts, the Bodhisatta also attained the observance of purity of livelihood (&#257;j&#299;va-p&#257;risuddhi-s&#299;la).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Reliable restraint of the six sense doors (indriya-sa&#7745;vara-s&#299;la). Unlike ordinary lay people, the Buddha did not need to make any special efforts to develop
new restraint of the six sense doors, since restraint of the senses was already an innate and achieved fact for him.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Nor did he need to make any special effort to observe moral conduct in relation to monastic paraphernalia (paccaya-sannissita-s&#299;la) in order to keep under control
the defilements that might arise from the four necessary things.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Even at the time when he was about to renounce the world, he had already temporarily rid himself of a number of unwholesome defilements, headed by greed and craving.
But the latent tendencies (anusaya) are eradicated only by attaining the state of an Arahant. This was the purity of morality (s&#299;la-visuddhi) of the Bodhisatta.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">2. Purity of Mind (citta-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;The eight attainments of deep concentration and the five mundane super-knowledges (abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;), acquired during his stay with the leaders of the ascetic communities of Alara and Udaka, had
become impure and dull, as if stained by defilements, like an unused great golden vessel, due to neglect of practice and development during his six years of ascetic discipline (dukkara-cariy&#257;). On the day he was to become
a Buddha, he partook of the thick milk-rice offered by Sujata and spent the daytime in the Sala forest. While he was there, he purified the eight attainments and the five super-knowledges, developing them anew, just as a stained
golden vessel is washed and cleaned. These eight attainments and the five super-knowledges constituted the purity of mind (citta-visuddhi) of the Bodhisatta.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">3. Purity of View (di&#7789;&#7789;hi-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;After this, the noble Bodhisatta went to the Mahabodhi tree in the evening and remained seated on the undefeated throne. He defeated Devaputta Mara before sunset.&nbsp;In the first watch of the night, he
developed knowledge of past existences. He saw clearly the phenomena of mind and matter (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa) and destroyed the twenty false views regarding the self (sakk&#257;ya-di&#7789;&#7789;hi). This was the purity of
view (di&#7789;&#7789;hi-visuddhi) of the Bodhisatta.<br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">4. The Purity of Overcoming Doubts (ka&#7749;kh&#257;-vitara&#7751;a-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;Then, in the middle watch of the night, he discerned living beings who attain different births according to their deeds, through the knowledge of the analysis of deeds that cause rebirth (yath&#257;-kamm&#363;paga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a),
which had the knowledge of the divine eye (dibba-cakkhu-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) as its basis. Seeing them, he clearly realized the law of volitional deeds (kamma) and by this realization he became free from doubts. This was
the purity of overcoming doubts (ka&#7749;kh&#257;-vitara&#7751;a-visuddhi) of the Bodhisatta.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">5. Purity of knowledge and understanding of the right and wrong paths (magg&#257;magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;In the last watch of the night, the Bodhisatta reflected on the twelve factors of the doctrine of dependent origination; and beginning with the contemplation of mind and body, on the basis of such contemplations
as the contemplation of impermanence (anicc&#257;nupassan&#257;), suffering (dukkh&#257;nupassan&#257;), and impersonality (anatt&#257;nupassan&#257;), in the five aggregates, he realized the knowledge of the arising and passing
away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) of all mental and material phenomena (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa). At that time, the defilements of insight (vipassan&#363;pakkilesa), such as radiance and others, arose in the Bodhisatta.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">A practitioner of insight meditation (vipassana), at a certain stage of development, contemplates again and again the arising and passing away of all mental and physical
phenomena previously grouped (into the five aggregates) and reaches the initial stage of knowledge of arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a). &quot;At this stage he usually sees an unusual light (obh&#257;sa),
feels a surge of rapture (p&#299;ti), tranquility (passaddhi), determination (adhimokkha), great energy (paggaha), happiness (sukha), knowledge (&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), intensity of mindfulness (upa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na),
equanimity (upekkh&#257;) and a gentle desire for that state (nikanti).&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">These states that arise in the practitioner at the stage of knowledge of arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a) in the ten phases are called
the defilements of insight (vipassan&#363;pakkilesa).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">(Visuddhimagga) translates this as &quot;imperfections of insight&quot; and lists them, ten in number:<br /></span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">1) Glow</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">2) knowledge</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">3) ecstatic happiness</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">4) calmness</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">5) bliss</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">6) determination</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">7) diligence</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">8) confidence</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">9) equanimity</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">10) affection</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">The practitioner who has reached this stage is subject to these defilements, and his mind may be caught up in &#39;spiritual agitation&#39; or &#39;anxiety about
higher states&#39; (dhamma-uddhacca). For example, having experienced a luminescence, he may feel that this constitutes an experience of the path, and thus hinder his further progress through self-deception. When an illumination
appears, the meditator thinks: &#39;Verily, never before has such an illumination arisen in me. Certainly I have attained the path; I have attained the fruit or jhana.&#39; Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path,
and what is not the fruit to be the fruit, what is not jhana. Due to this error, the progress of insight (vipassan&#257;) is stopped; leaving the original object of meditation, he remains enjoying the luminescence, etc.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The luminosity, as the Buddha&#39;s imperfection of insight, was not, like others, limited to one point, one region, or one part of a region. The Bodhisatta, by means
of the very keen, penetrating great insight knowledge mentioned above, contemplated the aggregates of phenomena (dhamm&#257;) in his own mind-stream and also in the mind-stream of innumerable sentient beings over three periods
of time. In general, he reduced them to the twelve factors of dependent origination (pa&#7789;icca-samupp&#257;da); and again, dividing these twelve factors into the two groups of mind and matter (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa), he
contemplated them by means of the knowledge of arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">His energy was very strong, his mindfulness very steady, his mind very collected, and therefore his insight wisdom was very sharp. His faith was very strong, his
physical and mental happiness and tranquility developed continuously. The mental factors of specific neutrality (tatra-majjhatatt&#257;-cetasika), also called equanimity, which regards all conditioned states with equanimity,
were also very strong.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The Bodhisatta&#39;s mental stream, supported and sustained by happiness (sukha) and tranquility (passaddhi), was filled with five kinds of delight:</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">1) Hair-raising rapture (khuddaka-p&#299;ti);</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">2) Rapture that arises from time to time, like a flash of lightning (kha&#7751;ika-p&#299;ti);</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">3) Rapture that floods the body and recedes like waves breaking on the seashore (okkantika-p&#299;ti);</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">4) Rapture so strong that it lifts the body into the air (ubbega-p&#299;ti);</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">5) Rapture that permeates the entire body, like soft cotton wool (phara&#7751;a-p&#299;ti).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">His blood, heart and senses were also very clear.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Therefore, the nimitta of the Bodhisattva&#39;s luminosity flooded the earth, the air mass, and the water mass of the lower regions, turning them golden yellow. Then
it sank into the boundless space below, and also upward to the supreme abode of beings, turning everything into golden yellow. The luminosity then continued to penetrate further into the upper boundless space. It also illuminated
all 10,000 world systems.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When such insight defilements arise, inexperienced meditators mistake them for paths and fruits. They abandon the original object of meditation and abide in the enjoyment
of the defilements. However, when these insight defilements arose in the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum, he reflected: &quot;This is not the path that leads to knowledge of the Arahant&#39;s path (Arahatta-magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
and omniscience (sabba&ntilde;&ntilde;ut&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), these are merely defilements of insight. Only the knowledge of arising and passing away in my original meditation forms the true path to knowledge of
the Arahant&#39;s path and omniscience.&quot; He did not allow his mind to hover over these insight defilements and become attached to them. Instead, he directed his mind to the object of insight.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">When the defiling elements of insight thus arose in the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum, he did not allow the subtle desire and greed known as craving (nikanti)
to arise, which craved these defiling elements. He had clear, extraordinary knowledge which clearly discerned that this group of defiling elements was not the right path to Awakening, but merely led to the defilement of insight.
Only the knowledge of arising and passing away and so forth formed the right path leading to Awakening. This was the purity of knowledge and insight into the Bodhisatta&#39;s right and wrong path (magg&#257;magga-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">6. Purity of knowledge and insight into the path (pa&#7789;ipad&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></strong></p>

<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><strong><span class="tm21">7. Purity of knowledge and insight (&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The set of nine insight knowledges (vipassan&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), beginning with the knowledge of arising and passing away (udayabbaya-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a)
and ending with the knowledge of adaptation (anuloma-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a), which have arisen in the Bodhisatta&#39;s mental continuum, are known as&nbsp;</span><strong><span
 class="tm21">the purity of knowledge and insight of the path (pa&#7789;ipad&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></strong><span
 class="tm22">&nbsp;The four noble paths (ariya-magga) are known as&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="tm21">the purity of knowledge and insight (&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a-dassana-visuddhi).</span></strong></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">Upakilesa Sutta: Flaws</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm26">MN 128</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Thus the above-described sequence of seven purifications constitutes the right and proper path to Nibbana.<br /><br />The Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and noble disciples
of the past, present, and future realize Nibbana only through the sequence of these seven purifications; and at least so do the noble persons who attain the noble path by easily, minimally developing the meditation on the
&quot;five parts of the body ending in the skin&quot; (taca-pa&ntilde;caka), or by listening to the discourse of the Dhamma in verse delivered by the Buddha. They attain the noble path (ariya-magga) by successively, quickly
passing through these seven purifications.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The following question may arise: If all the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and disciples of the three periods of time attain Nibbana only through the sequence of the seven
purifications, should not all these noble persons be the same in all respects? Why are there such differences as: He was a Buddha, a Paccekabuddha, a chief disciple (agga-savaka), a great disciple (maha-savaka), an ordinary
disciple (pacati-savaka)?</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The answer is: Although Nibbana is attained by all Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples only through the sequence of seven purifications, they are initially
distinguished in wisdom (panya), in practice (patipada), in faith (saddha) and innate tendencies (ajjhasaya-dhatu).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Therefore, noble persons who attain the fruit of Arahatship (Arahatta-phala) through the knowledge gained from hearing the Dhamma from others (suta-maya-&ntilde;ana),
after developing the perfections (parami) according to the strength of their faith (saddha) and wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a) over a period of about 100,000 eons, are called ordinary disciples (pakati-savaka) and great disciples
(maha-savaka).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Noble persons who attain the fruit of Arahatship through knowledge based on hearing (suta-maya-nyana), after developing the perfections for one immeasurable period
and 100,000 eons, or a little less, are called chief disciples (agga-savaka).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Noble persons who attain the fruit of Arahatship through self-acquired knowledge, without learning from others (sayambhu-&ntilde;ana), but after developing the perfections
over a period of two immeasurable periods and 100,000 eons, but are unable to teach others the Dhamma that will enable them to attain the paths (magga), fruits (phala) and Nibbana, are called Paccekabuddhas.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The noble, peerless personalities who, after courageously performing the perfections for the minimum period of four immeasurable periods and 100,000 eons and performing
the five great acts of abandonment that do not concern the Paccekabodhisattvas and Savakabodhisattvas&nbsp;</span><u><sup><a
 href="#footnote7"><span class="tm22">7</span></a><a id="footnote7back"></a></sup></u><span class="tm22">, attain the fruit of Arahatship with omniscience (sabbannyuta-nyana) without learning from
others (sayambhu-nyana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Being excellent in the use of words, they give Dhamma instructions with four kinds of depth: the depth of subtle text, the depth of meaning, the depth of teaching,
and the depth of penetrating wisdom. They do this in different ways to suit the innate tendencies of sentient beings. They are able to lead all beings they teach to the paths, fruits, and Nibbana, and thus become their refuge.
They are called the Completely Self-Awakened Ones, the omniscient Buddhas, the Lords of the Three Worlds. Since our noble Bodhisatta was also of this nature, he too is the Completely Self-Awakened One, the Lord of the Three
Worlds, and the peerless Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm27">Sublime Saying</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">The Bodhisatta, who had thus attained omniscience and had acquired all the attributes and glory of Buddhahood, reflected thus: &quot;Indeed, I have been liberated
from the great suffering of Samsara. Indeed, I have attained the supreme state of the Completely Self-Awakened One, the teacher of the three worlds. Indeed, I have attained the great victory. I am the one who can liberate
all living beings from the bondage of the three worlds through the teaching of Dhamma.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">As he was thus reflecting, rapturous joy (piti) arose in the Buddha&#39;s stream of consciousness. With the tempo of the joy thus arising, the Buddha recited, as
was the established practice of all omniscient Buddhas after attaining Buddhahood, the following two verses of intense joy (Dhp 153-154):</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">&quot;Aneka-jati-samsaram, sandhavissam anibbisam,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">gahakaram gavesanto, dukkha jati punappunam.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">Not being able to cut off the root of repeated existences in Samsara, taking birth in the four ways: born from an egg, born from a womb, born from moisture, and spontaneously
born - this is great suffering, since the body from rebirth is inevitably pursued and oppressed by aging, illness, and death, there is no happiness in this, only hardship and suffering. Therefore, as a Bodhisatta, seeking
a diligent builder of this house of the aggregates (khandha), and not finding him, since I had not yet acquired the great omniscience (sabbannuta-nyana) that clearly discerns the true culprit, namely craving, the carpenter,
as the cause of suffering (dukkha), I had to wander restlessly, turning with the wheel of Samsara, although I had no attachment to the dukkha-producing five aggregates and was constantly afraid of them.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">&quot;Gaha-karaka ditthosi, puna geham na kahasi,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">sabba te phasuka bhagga, gaha-kutam visakhatam,</span></em></p>
<p class="tm15"><span class="tm9"></span><em><span class="tm24">visankhara-gatam cittam, tanhanam khayam-ajjhaga.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm22">You! Craving, the carpenter, the evil cause of dukkha, who diligently builds the house of the five aggregates that are entangled in suffering! Now, having become
a Buddha and possessing omniscience, I clearly discern you, craving, the builder of the house! You will no longer build the house of the five aggregates entangled with suffering, because your legs, your arms, and your life
have been cut off four times by the axe of knowledge of the path (magga-&ntilde;ana), and you are like a torn-out stump. All the rafters of the defilements, firmly fixed in the decorated house of the aggregates, have now been
smashed to pieces, leaving not even the slightest trace of past tendencies and innate inclinations. Ignorance (avijja), the master of the house, which hides the four truths and Nibbana from view and keeps them far, far away,
has been reduced to dust. My mind, freed from the defilements of this filth, has attained Nibbana, the palace of peace, beyond the sphere of the conditioned (sankhara) and all the suffering of Samsara. I, the supreme Buddha
of the three worlds, have realized the fourth (Arahat) path and fruit, the cessation of the 108 forms of craving for the delight and praise of the Devas and Brahmas of the 10,000 world system.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">The 108 forms of thirst (tanha) are the root cause of suffering and the cause of the ever-continuing cycle of rebirth. They are synonymous with greed (lobha or raga).
It has three aspects:<br /><br />Sensual thirst (kama-tanha);<br />Thirst for rebirth, especially in the higher worlds (bhava-tanha); Thirst for self-destruction (vibhava-tanha).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">Corresponding to the six objects of the senses, each of these aspects of craving is multiplied into six forms of craving, namely:<br /><br />craving for visible objects
(rupa-tanha),<br />sounds (sadda-tanha),<br />odors (gandha-tanha),<br />tastes (rasa-tanha),<br />bodily impressions (photthabbha-tanha),<br />mental impressions (dhamma-tanha),<br /><br />thus making up eighteen forms of
craving.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">Further, taking into account the three periods of time - present, past and future - which apply to each of these eighteen forms of craving, 54 different forms of
craving can be distinguished. Finally, these 54 forms of craving can arise in the stream of consciousness of one&#39;s own or others; thus, there are 108 forms of craving in all.</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">There are two kinds of sublime sayings (udana):<br /><br />Those spoken only mentally (manasa-udana)<br />Those spoken verbally (vacasa-udana).<br /><br />The sublime
saying beginning with&nbsp;</span><em><span class="tm28">&quot;Aneka-jati-samsaram&quot;, &quot;not being able to cut off the root of repeated existences in Samsara&quot;,</span></em><span
 class="tm25">&nbsp;etc., were spoken by the Buddha only mentally and should therefore be considered as being spoken mentally (manasa-udana).<br /><br />The sublime sayings in the Udana text beginning with (Ud 1.1):&nbsp;</span><em><span
 class="tm28">&quot;Yada have patu bhavanti dhamma&quot;, &quot;when (the nature of) things actually becomes apparent&quot;,</span></em><span
 class="tm25">&nbsp;etc., were spoken verbally by the Buddha. Therefore, the sublime sayings in the Udana text should be considered as being spoken verbally (vacasa-udana).</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="tm20"><span class="tm9"></span><span class="tm25">The categories of Dhamma mentioned in this chapter on his becoming a Buddha, namely:<br />dependent origination (paticca-samuppada),<br />the four analytical knowledges
(patisambhid&#257;-&ntilde;&#257;na),<br />the six unique knowledges (asadh&#257;ra&#7751;a-&ntilde;&#257;na),<br />the ten powers (dasa-bala-&ntilde;&#257;na),<br />the fourteen knowledges of the Buddha (cudd&#257;sa-buddha-&ntilde;&#257;na),<br />the
eighteen special qualities (avenika-gu&#7751;a),<br />the four valiant wisdoms (ves&#257;rajja-&ntilde;&#257;na)<br /><br />will be described later, neither too briefly nor too fully, in the chapter on the Dhamma Jewel.</span></p>
