<p class="tm38">Taking refuge (sarana gamana) and the five precepts (pa&ntilde;ca-s&#299;la sam&#257;d&#257;na) are the first two steps taken by a person wishing to become a lay follower of the Buddha. In the first step, a
person resolves to make the Buddha, his teaching (Dhamma), and the community of monks (Sangha) the ideals that will guide his life. The second step involves a determination to bring his actions into harmony with these ideals
through right conduct. The two sections presented here are intended to provide a clear and detailed description of these steps. Although this material is intended for those who have only recently accepted the Buddha&#39;s
teaching, it may also be useful to those who have been following it for a long time and wish to understand the meaning of those elements of spiritual practice with which they are already familiar. It will also be useful to
readers who wish to learn what it takes to become a Buddhist.</p>
<p class="tm38">In order to keep the presentation compact and to avoid the inconveniences imposed by the format of a scholarly work, references to primary sources have been kept to a minimum. Therefore, I will now list the
sources on which this work is based. The section on &quot;Taking Refuge&quot; is based primarily on the standard text included, with minor variations, in the commentary to the Khuddakapatha, in the commentary to the Digha
Nikaya, and in the commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya. The fragment from the commentary to the Khuddakapatha has been translated in Bhikkhu Nyanamoli&#39;s editions &quot;Minor readings&quot; and &quot;The illustrator&quot;,
and the text from the commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya in Nyanaponika Thera&#39;s pamphlet &quot;The Threefold Refuge&quot;.</p>

<p class="tm42">The Buddha&#39;s teaching can be compared to a building, with its own foundation, floors, stairs and roof. Like every building, this teaching has a door, and to get inside we must enter through this door. The
door or entrance to the Buddha&#39;s teaching is taking refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the enlightened teacher, the Dhamma, the Truth he taught, and the Sangha, the community of his noble disciples. From ancient times
to the present day, taking refuge has been the first step into the Buddha&#39;s teaching, opening the way to the rest of it from the ground floor to the top. All those who accept the Buddha&#39;s teaching enter through the
door by taking refuge, and those who have previously taken it regularly reaffirm their commitment with the following threefold affirmation:</p>
<p class="tm44"><span class="tm45">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Buddha&#7747;

go to the Sangha for refuge</p>
<p class="tm49">However insignificant and trivial this step may seem, especially in comparison with the subsequent high achievements, it should not be underestimated, because it is this act that sets the direction and gives
forward momentum to the entire subsequent practice of the Buddhist teaching. Since taking refuge plays such an important role, a proper understanding of both the immediate significance of this act and its deep meaning is absolutely
necessary for progress along the path. In order to make the process of taking refuge accessible to deep understanding, we will examine its most important aspects. For this purpose, we will consider the following topics: reasons
for taking refuge, the existence of refuge, the definition of objects of refuge, the act of taking refuge, the purpose of taking refuge, the ways of taking refuge, distortion and violation of refuge, analogies illustrating
the taking of refuge.</p>
<h2 class="tm50"><strong><a id="aheading_h_zcd19kfcwusn"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">I. Reasons for Taking Refuge</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">When it is stated that the practice of the Buddha&#39;s teaching begins with taking refuge, this immediately raises an important question. The question is, &quot;Why do we need refuge at all?&quot; A refuge
is a person, place, or thing that provides protection from danger and harm. Therefore, since we begin a practice by taking refuge, this implies that the practice is for protection from harm and danger. So our initial question
about the need for refuge can be rephrased as follows: &quot;What is the harm and danger from which we need protection?&quot; Looking at our life as a whole, we may not find ourselves exposed to any imminent threat. We may
have a stable job, be in perfect health, enjoy an abundance of family and provision. Such a state of affairs may give reason to consider ourselves to be completely safe. Under such circumstances, taking refuge becomes entirely
unnecessary.</p>
<p class="tm38">To understand the need for it, one must learn to see one&#39;s situation as it really is, examining it more carefully and from different points of view. In Buddhism, it is believed that a person&#39;s situation
in this world is like an iceberg: only a small part is visible on the surface, while the main mass is hidden under water, inaccessible to the eye. Due to the limitations of our thinking, we cannot penetrate the crust of the
&quot;iceberg&quot; and realize our situation in all its depth. However, there is no point in even talking about what cannot be seen, since we rarely perceive correctly even what is quite accessible to our sight. The Buddha
teaches that selective recognition (sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;) is conditioned by our desires.</p>
<p class="tm52">Our hidden desires subtly condition our perception of reality, giving it the form they themselves establish for it. Our mind works by selection and exclusion. We notice what pleases our prejudices and reject
or distort what threatens to disprove them.</p>
<p class="tm38">From the perspective of deeper and fuller understanding, the sense of security we normally experience arises as a false sense, sustained by ignorance and the mind&#8217;s ability to play tricks. Our situation
only appears stable because of the limitations and distortions of our view of the world. The true path to security is through correct vision, not through wishful thinking. To go beyond fear and danger, we must make our vision
clearer and broader. To know the deep essence of our existence, we must overcome the delusions that tend toward pleasant complacency, without turning away from the unpleasant or following anything that leads astray. As we
move along this path, we will increasingly realize that we are walking along a narrow path over a bottomless abyss. In the words of the Buddha, we are like a traveler walking through a dense forest bordering a swamp and an
abyss. We are like a man who has been washed into a river and is clinging to the aquatic vegetation in an effort to get out. We are like a sailor crossing a stormy sea or a man pursued by poisonous snakes and cruel enemies.
The dangers to which we are exposed may not be obvious at the moment. Often they are subtle, disguised and deeply hidden. But although they may not be obvious to us, the fact remains that these dangers exist and have not disappeared.
If we want to free ourselves from them, we must first try to understand what exactly is threatening us. However, this requires courage and determination.</p>
<p class="tm54">The Buddha&#39;s teaching <a href="http://dhamma.ru/canon/an/an5-78.htm">states that </a>the dangers from which one must begin to seek refuge can be divided into three groups: (1) dangers in this life, (2)
dangers in future lives, and (3) dangers that beset us throughout our entire existence. Each of the three groups has two aspects: (A) the objective aspect, which is a characteristic of the world in which we live, and (B) the
subjective aspect, which exists due to the properties of our mind. Let us consider them separately.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">1. Dangers in Current Life</a></u>  </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38"><strong><span class="tm55">A. </span></strong>The objective aspect. The most obvious danger we face is the obvious fragility of our physical body and its material components. From birth we are subject to illness,
accidents and injuries. Nature brings us trouble in the form of earthquakes and floods, the presence of crime, exploitation and repression, and the threat of war. Events in political, economic and social life rarely proceed
calmly without giving rise to another crisis. Revolutions and attempts at reform continue their vicious cycle, leading to stagnation, violence and the collapse of illusions that follows. Even in relatively calm times our lives
are far from perfect. It seems as if one thing or another is constantly trying to escape our attention. Obstacles and difficulties constantly replace one another.</p>
<p class="tm38">Even if we are fortunate enough to escape serious troubles, there is one we cannot escape. That is death. We are destined to die, and with all our wealth, skills, and power, we remain helpless in the face of
our inevitable demise. Death lies in wait for us from the moment we are born. Every second we are brought closer to the inevitable. As we are carried through life, the feeling of security in the midst of all comforts is like
the blind conviction of a man walking on a frozen lake, the ice cracking under his feet.</p>
<p class="tm38">The dangers hanging over us are further aggravated by the uncertainty that is their common characteristic. We do not suspect when they will come upon us. If we knew of the impending trouble, we could have time
to prepare and stoically resign ourselves to the inevitable. But we do not have even that kind of power over the future. Since we lack the ability to foresee, our defenseless hopes are constantly accompanied by a vague presentiment
that at any moment, at any second, they can be smashed to pieces. Our health can be undermined by illness, a business can fail, friends can turn against us, loved ones can die - and we do not know about it in advance. There
is no guarantee that all these changes will not affect us. Only death is a certain event in the sense that one day it will certainly happen. When exactly - remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="tm38"><strong><span class="tm55">B. </span></strong>Subjective aspect. The above-mentioned dangers are integral features that make up the nature of our world. On the one hand, there are cataclysms, crises and difficulties,
and on the other, their complete uncertainty. Subjective aspect. The dangers in our current life are our negative reaction to this double threat.</p>
<p class="tm38">The element of uncertainty tries to provoke in us a constant feeling of anxiety, arising under the guise of our self-confidence. At a deep level, we sense the instability of what we rely on, its temporariness
and changeability. This feeling creates an annoying sense of concern, sometimes reaching the point of tangible fear. We are not always able to identify the cause of anxiety, but it is always present in the deep layers of consciousness.
It is an unconscious fear that one day what we rely on may disappear, leaving us without the usual value system.</p>
<p class="tm38">Anxiety itself is a full-fledged source of trouble. Often our fears are justified. The course of events takes its own course, independently of our wishes and not always in accordance with them. People are at
the mercy of illness, loss and death, which strike when the time comes. When the course of events contradicts our wishes, the result is pain and discontent. When the contradiction is small, we are angry, sad, melancholy or
worried. When it is large, we experience torment, grief or despair. In both cases, from the gap between desire and reality, a fundamental discrepancy arises, causing us to suffer.</p>
<p class="tm38">The suffering that arises is of no particular importance in itself. It is merely a manifestation of some deeper underlying disease. The &#8220;disease&#8221; lies in our attitude toward the world around us.
We act within the cage of expectations, plans, and demands. We expect reality to conform to our wishes, to obey our instructions, and to conform to our prejudices, but it refuses to do so. When it is refused, we experience
the pain and disappointment that arise from the contradiction between the expected and the reality. For suffering to end, one of two things must change: either our wishes or the world around us. Since we cannot change the
essence of the world around us, the only way out is to change ourselves, giving up attachment and aversion to its objects. We must abandon our attachments, cease to crave and grasp, and learn to observe events impartially,
free from exultation and despondency.</p>
<p class="tm38">The mind&#39;s capacity for impartial observation, transcending the influence of the opposites of this world, is the highest protection and safety. But to develop this capacity, we need guidance. The guidance
available to us cannot protect us from objective dangers. It can only protect us from the sufferings brought about by negative reactions - anxiety, sorrow, disappointment and despair. This is the only possible protection,
and since through guidance we can obtain this much needed thing, it should be considered the true refuge.</p>
<p class="tm54">This is the first reason for seeking refuge - the need for protection from negative reactions to the dangers that await us here and now.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">2. Dangers in future lives</a></u>  </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38"><strong><span class="tm55">A. </span></strong>Objective aspect. Human susceptibility to harm and danger does not end at death. According to the Buddha&#39;s teaching, death precedes rebirth, that is, it can
become a starting point for new suffering. Buddha taught that all living beings bound by ignorance and thirst cannot avoid rebirth. As long as the thirst for becoming remains, the individual flow of being continues to exist
after death, inheriting the impressions and characteristics accumulated in the previous life. No &quot;soul&quot; is carried over from one life to another, there is only a stream of consciousness, which after death begins
to &quot;flow&quot; in a new physical body corresponding to the tendencies inherent in this consciousness.</p>
<p class="tm38">In Buddhism, it is believed that rebirth can occur on any of six levels of existence. The lowest level is hell, a world of intense pain and torture where beings go to atone for their bad deeds. The level above
is the animal world, where suffering dominates and the strongest rules. The next world is inhabited by hungry ghosts (peta) &#8211; dark creatures with strong desires that they are unable to satisfy. Above that is the world
of humans, with the familiar balance of happiness and suffering, skillful and unskillful. Next comes the world of demigods (asura) &#8211; giants consumed by envy and aspirations. At the very top are the heavenly worlds, inhabited
by gods (deva).</p>
<p class="tm38">The first three of these levels (hell, the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm), as well as the asura realm, are considered &quot;bad realms&quot; (duggati) or &quot;suffering realms&quot; (apayabhumi). They
are so called because of the suffering that prevails in them. The realms of humans and gods, on the other hand, are called &quot;happy realms&quot; (sugati) because happiness prevails in them. Birth in one of the unhappy realms
is considered especially undesirable, not only because of the inevitable suffering that follows, but for another reason as well. Such rebirth is a disaster because it is extremely difficult to leave these realms. Rebirth in
a happy realm depends on performing skillful actions. But in the unhappy realms, beings have very little opportunity to perform them, so suffering must be experienced again and again because of the repeated cycle of rebirth
in these realms, from which it is very difficult to escape. The Buddha compared the chance of escaping from the miserable world to the human world to the chance of a blind tortoise living in the vast sea getting its head caught
in a free-floating yoke, provided that the tortoise comes to the surface once every hundred years. For these two reasons &#8211; the inevitable suffering and the difficulty of escaping &#8211; rebirth in the miserable realms
is the gravest danger in the future life, from which we need protection.</p>
<p class="tm57"><strong><span class="tm55">B. </span></strong>Subjective aspect. Other people cannot protect us from falling into unhappy realms. The only way is to avoid everything that leads to rebirth there. The cause of
rebirth at any level of existence lies in our karma - intentions and intentional actions. Karma is of two types - skillful and unskillful. The first is accumulated by actions based on renunciation, goodwill and wisdom, and
the second - on greed, hatred and delusion [ignorance]. These two types of karma lead to birth in the corresponding realms:</p>
<p class="tm52">good karma is in the happy, bad karma is in the unhappy.</p>
<p class="tm38">We cannot destroy the unhappy worlds, they will exist as long as this world exists. The only way to avoid rebirth there is by observing ourselves, controlling our behavior so that there are no unskillful actions
that can lead us to unhappy worlds. But in order to stop the accumulation of unskillful karma, we need help, for which there are two main reasons.</p>
<p class="tm38">Firstly, help is needed because of the large number and variety of behavior options available to us, and we often do not know which one to choose. For some actions it is easy to determine whether they are skillful
or not, but all others are difficult to analyze, and when we encounter them we are confused. To make the right choice, we need help - a precise hint from a person who knows the moral value of any action and the paths leading
to birth at different levels of being.</p>
<p class="tm38">The second reason we need help is our tendency to choose what is unskillful, even when we are able to discern what is skillful and what is unskillful. Our actions are not always in accordance with our dispassionate
decisions [about them]. We are often impulsive, driven by inexplicable desires that we cannot control or subdue. In indulging these impulses, we harm ourselves, sometimes simply by watching helplessly. We need to learn to
control our minds, bringing our capacity to act under the control of a sense of higher wisdom. But this task requires special discipline. To learn proper self-discipline, we need instruction from someone who understands the
deep workings of the mind and can teach us how to overcome the poisons that incline us to harmful behavior. Since these instructions and the person giving them save us from future harm and suffering, they can be considered
a real refuge.</p>
<p class="tm38">This second reason for taking refuge is the need to learn control over one&#39;s actions in order to avoid falling into unhappy realms in future lives.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">3. Dangers that lie in wait for us throughout our existence</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38"><strong><span class="tm55">A. </span></strong>The objective aspect. The other misfortunes to which we are subject are far greater than those explained above. Apart from the obvious difficulties and misfortunes
of this life or the risk of falling into a bad world in the next, there is a far deeper and more pervasive danger that is present throughout the entire period of existence. This is the essential unsatisfactoriness of Samsara.
Samsara is the cycle of becoming, the circle of birth, aging and death, revolving from a beginningless past. Rebirth occurs more than once and does not lead to eternal life after death. With each turn of the wheel, the life
cycle is repeated in full: birth is followed by aging and death, and each death is inevitably followed by a new birth. Rebirth occurs in a happy or an unhappy world, but wherever it occurs, the wheel does not stop turning.
The law of impermanence imposes its conditions on all the diversity of living beings: everything that has come into being must eventually disappear. Even the heavenly worlds are no exception. Life ends when the karma that
led to getting there is exhausted. This is followed by rebirth in another world, possibly in one of the unfortunate ones.</p>
<p class="tm38">Because of the essential impermanence of all forms of conditioned existence, when looked at deeply they are considered unsatisfactory or sources of suffering (dukkha). Nothing that we hope or desire is free
from changeability and impermanence. Therefore, everything that we resort to for comfort and pleasant sensations is in fact a hidden form of suffering. That which we rely on for our safety is itself subject to danger. Everything
to which we turn for protection is itself in need of protection. Nothing that we wish to possess will be ours forever without disappearing: &#8220;It is destroyed, it is destroyed, and therefore it is called &#8216;this world.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="tm38">Youth ends in old age, good health in illness, life in death. Every union ends in separation and the suffering that goes with it. To understand the depth and gravity of this situation, one must multiply it
by infinity. Since the beginningless past, we have been reborn in the circle of becoming, again and again experiencing the same experiences with dizzying frequency: birth, aging, illness and death, separation and loss, failure
and disappointment. Many times we have fallen into unhappy worlds, countless lives have been lived in the form of an animal, a spirit or a hell dweller. Again and again we have been subjected to violence, suffering, grief
and despair. Buddha said that the amount of tears and blood we have shed during our wanderings in the ocean of samsara is greater than the water in the ocean, and the pile of bones left behind us will be <a
 href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/iti/iti1.html#24">higher than the Himalayas . </a>We have encountered these sufferings countless times in the past, and until the causes of wandering in Samsara are
destroyed, we risk experiencing even more suffering as we continue to exist in it.</p>
<p class="tm38"><strong><span class="tm55">B. </span></strong>The Subjective Aspect. There is only one way to escape these dangers: to detach ourselves from all forms of becoming, even the highest. But for detachment to really
take place, we must destroy the causes that bind us to the round of rebirth. The real causes that give rise to wandering in Samsara lie within ourselves. The Buddha taught that we wander from life to life under the influence
of a deep and insatiable desire for further becoming. He calls this desire craving for becoming (bhava-ta&#7751;h&#257;). As long as craving for becoming continues to function, even if imperceptibly, death will not be an obstacle
to the continuation of the cycle of life. Craving will fill the vacuum created by death, giving rise to a new form of becoming determined by the karma accumulated earlier. Thus craving and becoming successively give rise to
each other. Craving shapes new becoming, and new becoming is the platform on which craving continues its search for pleasures.</p>
<p class="tm38">At the root of this terrible chain of craving and re-becoming is an even deeper factor called &#39;ignorance&#39; (avijj&#257;). Ignorance is the essential unawareness of the true nature of things, a beginningless
state of spiritual unknowing. This ignorance operates in two different ways: first, it obstructs correct cognition, and second, it creates a web of distortions of cognition and perception. Because of ignorance, we see beauty
in what is actually disgusting, permanent in what is impermanent, pleasure in what is unpleasant, a person or soul in an impersonal object that contains no eternal essence. These delusions stimulate the forward movement of
craving. Like a donkey harnessed to a cart and running after a carrot dangled in front of its nose, we rush headlong after manifestations of beauty, permanence, pleasure and personality, only to be left empty-handed, further
entangled in the circle of Samsara.</p>
<p class="tm38">To be free from this meaningless and useless cycle, the craving that drives it must be destroyed, not by suppressing it temporarily, but by ending it once and for all. To destroy craving, the ignorance that
sustains it must be overthrown, for as long as ignorance is allowed to weave its illusions, there will be a ground for craving to arise again. The antidote to ignorance is wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a). Wisdom is the penetrating
knowledge that tears through the screen of ignorance and allows one to &quot;see things as they really are.&quot; It is not mere knowledge of facts, but an experience that must be experienced for oneself. It must be direct,
immediate, and personal. To develop such wisdom, we need instruction, help, and guidance. We need someone to teach us what specifically we must understand and see for ourselves, and how we can cultivate the liberating wisdom
that can cut the bonds that bind us to repeated becoming. Since the people who provide this guidance and give the actual instructions provide protection from the torment of rebirth, these people can be considered a true refuge.</p>
<p class="tm59">This is the third reason for taking refuge &#8211; the need for liberation from the all-consuming unsatisfactoriness of Samsara.</p>
<h2 class="tm60"><strong><a id="aheading_h_przokn5pdoan"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">II. The existence of refuge</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">To recognize that one&#39;s situation requires one to seek refuge is a necessary condition for taking it. But this recognition alone is not sufficient. In order to take something as a refuge, we must be convinced
that an effective refuge actually exists. But before we can decide whether a refuge exists, we must first understand what kind of refuge it should be.</p>
<p class="tm38">The dictionary defines &quot;refuge&quot; as a shelter or protection from danger and suffering, as a person or place that provides protection, and as a means of obtaining that protection. This is close to the
meaning of the term sara&#7751;a, meaning refuge, mentioned in the commentaries on the Pali texts. The commentaries give another definition of sara&#7751;a, meaning &quot;to break&quot; (hi&#7747;sati). It says that &quot;when
one has taken refuge, it itself breaks, dispels, destroys and stops fear, suffering, the risk of rebirth in an unhappy world and the development of new vices.&quot;</p>
<p class="tm38">The explanations given there provide two necessary criteria for a refuge. (1) First, the refuge must itself be free from danger and suffering. A person or object that is itself in danger cannot be inherently
safe and therefore cannot protect others. Only something that is not subject to fear and danger can be fully relied upon for protection. (2) Second, the potential refuge must be accessible to us. A state in which there is
no fear and danger but which lies beyond our reach has nothing to do with the subject of our consideration and cannot be considered a refuge. In order to function as a refuge, it must be accessible and provide protection from
danger.</p>
<p class="tm38">Having made this abstract calculation of the characteristics of a true refuge, we can return to the original question. Is there really a refuge that can protect us from the dangers listed above: the worries
and disappointments, the sorrows and sufferings of this life, the risk of being reborn in an unhappy world, and the continuous wandering in Samsara? The task of finding an answer to this question must be approached with caution.
We must immediately recognize that it is impossible to give an answer that would be open to objective verification and public demonstration. The existence in general or the characteristics of a particular refuge cannot be
logically proven in an irrefutable and comprehensive manner. The most that can be done is to give convincing arguments for the belief that certain people or things possess the qualities of a refuge. Then everything depends
on faith, on confidence based on trust, at least until this initial conviction is transformed into knowledge through direct experience. But even at this stage, the verification is purely internal and personal; it is a matter
of subjective assessment, not logical proof or objective demonstration.</p>
<p class="tm38">From the Buddhist point of view, there are three refuges that together provide complete protection from danger and suffering. These refuges are the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Individually, they are
not self-sufficient refuges. They are interdependent parts of one effective refuge, which is divided into three components according to the characteristics and functions they perform. The reason for this division becomes clear
if we consider the order in which these three are presented.</p>
<p class="tm38">The Buddha comes first because he is a human being. Since we ourselves are human beings, it is natural for us to look to other human beings for guidance, inspiration, and direction. When it comes to final liberation,
we first look for a person who has himself been completely freed from danger and who can lead us to the same state. This is the Buddha, the enlightened one, who comes first in the trinity because he is the person who discovered,
achieved, and proclaimed the state for which one goes for refuge. Second in line, we need that state itself, in which there is no fear or danger. Then we need a path to reach it, and a system of instructions to guide us along
that path. This is the Dhamma, which, as we shall see, has these three characteristics. Third, we need people who, like ourselves, have entered upon the path of practice because of the suffering they experience. Following
the path that the Buddha taught, these people have reached the state in which there is no fear or danger. This is the Sangha, the community of followers of the teaching, who have trodden the path and reached the goal. Such
people can show the way to others.</p>
<p class="tm38">In this trinity, each component fits harmoniously with the others, making the means of achieving liberation accessible and effective. Buddha is the identifying sign of refuge. He is not a savior who personally
grants liberation. Salvation or liberation depends on ourselves, on our perseverance and determination in the practice of the teaching. Buddha is, first of all, a teacher who has opened the way for us, indicating the road
that we must follow by making our own efforts and using our intelligence. The real refuge is Dhamma. It is the goal of the teaching, that is, the state of safety, and the path, that is, the means to achieve this goal. In addition,
Dhamma is the name for the teaching expressed in words, that is, the set of instructions describing the methods of practice. But in order to effectively use the means at our disposal, we need the help of those who have mastered
this path well. Those who have learned the path make up the Sangha, a community of people who can help us find refuge and lead us to achievement on the path of practice.</p>
<p class="tm59">A simple analogy helps us understand the meaning of the threefold structure of refuge. If we are sick and want to get well, we need a doctor to diagnose the disease and prescribe treatment. To cure the disease,
we need medicine, and we need nurses to look after us until we get well. The doctor and nurses cannot cure the disease themselves. They can only prescribe the right medicine and make sure that we take it. What actually makes
us healthy is the medicine. Similarly, when we seek relief from suffering and torment, we rely on the Buddha as the doctor who can identify the cause of the disease and show us the way to cure it. We rely on the Dhamma as
the medicine that cures the disease and on the Sangha as the nurses who help us get well. In order to get well, we must take the medicine ourselves. We cannot just sit back and wait for the doctor to cure us with his own hands.
In the same way, to get rid of suffering, we need to practice Dhamma, because it is the real refuge that leads to liberation.</p>
<h2 class="tm50"><strong><a id="aheading_h_t9979mqi9j2z"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">III. Consideration of the components of refuge</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">The benefit of taking refuge is proportionate to the depth and precision of our understanding of the essence of its objects. Therefore, we need to examine these objects carefully and make sure that our understanding
of them is correct. Each object of refuge can be distinguished by two meanings - a concrete mundane one and an intangible supramundane one. They are not completely independent and intersect in the sense that the first carries
the second within itself. Examining each object of refuge separately will show what their dual meaning is and how they intersect.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">1. Buddha</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">The Buddha is the first component of the threefold refuge. In the first sense, the word Buddha refers to a specific historical figure, a man named Siddhatha Gotama, who lived in India in the 5th century BCE.
When we go to the Buddha for refuge, we take refuge in the person because he is the one who teaches the Dhamma and is the founder of Buddhism. However, in this process, we do not seek refuge in his human form. We place our
hope in the Buddha as an enlightened one, and the meaning of this act far exceeds the limitations imposed by the mere historical fact [of his existence]. It is the accomplishment of a supra-mundane attainment that enables
the Buddha to serve as a refuge for us. The attainment here refers to the state of the Buddha, that is, the supreme Awakening. Others have achieved this in the past, and there will be others in the future who will also be
able to achieve it. Anyone who has achieved this attainment is called a Buddha. We rely on the Buddha for refuge because he represents this attainment. The attained state of Buddha makes him his refuge.</p>
<p class="tm38">But what is this state? The state of Buddha is the sum of the qualities that a man named Gotama possessed and which make him a Buddha. These qualities can be generally represented as the destruction of all
faults and the development of all virtues.</p>
<p class="tm38">The defects destroyed are the vices (kilesa) and their residual effects (v&#257;san&#257;). The vices are the mental forces that are the source of suffering. They poison a person from within, cause anxiety
and push him to commit unskillful actions. Among them, the chief ones are greed, hatred and delusion, from which all other vices are born. In the Buddha, all these vices are destroyed to the last one, completely and finally.
&quot;To the last one&quot; means that absolutely all vices without exception are destroyed. &quot;Completely&quot; means that each vice has been eradicated so that nothing remains of it. &quot;Finally&quot; means that they
will never arise in the future.</p>
<p class="tm38">The virtues of the Buddha are many, but two stand out: great wisdom (mahapa&ntilde;&ntilde;a) and great compassion (maha-karu&#7751;a). The great wisdom of the Buddha has two aspects: breadth of vision and
depth of understanding. Thanks to the breadth of vision, the Buddha understands the diversity of phenomena that occur. Thanks to the depth of understanding, he realizes all the details of the existence of each phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tm38">The wisdom of the Buddha does not remain in passive contemplation, but finds its expression in great compassion. Through great compassion, the Buddha begins to work for the benefit of others. He energetically
and fearlessly takes on the burden of hard work for the benefit of living beings in order to lead them to liberation from suffering.</p>
<p class="tm54">When we take refuge in the Buddha, we turn to him as the embodiment of purity, wisdom and compassion, as an incomparable teacher who can show us the way out of the turbulent ocean of Samsara to safety.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">2. Dhamma</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">Dhamma also has a double meaning. The first and simplest meaning of the word &quot;dhamma&quot; is the teaching of the Buddha, which is the totality of the religious doctrine taught by the Buddha Gotama, formulated
in concepts and expressed in words, or the teachings that arose from it. This teaching, called &quot;transmission&quot; (&#257;gama), is contained in the Tipitaka (the Three Baskets of the Pali Canon) and in commentaries and
other works that explain the meaning of the scriptures. The three baskets of teachings are the Vinaya Pitaka, the Sutta Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Vinaya Pitaka contains all the monastic rules, detailing the norms
of behavior for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Buddha&#39;s sermons, explaining his religious doctrine and methods of spiritual practice. The Abhidhamma Pitaka is a description of reality from the point
of view of precise philosophical understanding, which examines its fundamental components and shows how they are interconnected in a network of cause and effect relationships.</p>
<p class="tm38">The Dhamma transmitted orally and recorded in the Tipitaka and its commentaries serves as a guide to the deeper meaning conveyed in words and phrases. It is the Dhamma of concrete attainment (adhigama), consisting
of the path (magga) and the goal (attha). The goal is the final point of the teaching, called Nibbana, the complete cessation of suffering. It is the unconditioned state, beyond the cycle of impermanent components of Samsara.
To this goal leads a specific path, which is a method of practice that leads to its attainment. This is the Noble Eightfold Path: right understanding, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness and right concentration. The path is divided into two stages &#8211; the mundane and the supramundane. The mundane path is the path of practice, progress in which occurs due to its factors, which are perfected
both in daily life and during periods of intensive practice. The supramundane path is the wisdom that arises in the consciousness when all the qualities necessary for it have fully matured, which usually happens during intensive
practice. This path is actually the state in which the experience of Awakening is gained. Its dual function is the attainment of Nibbana and the destruction of defilements.</p>
<p class="tm38">The supramundane path is experienced in the form of brief insights that bring about radical changes in the structure of the mind. There are four of these insights, which is why they are called the &quot;four
paths.&quot; They differ in that each successive path destroys progressively more subtle fetters that bind us to Samsara. The first path, the initial breakthrough to Awakening, is called the path of stream entry (sot&#257;pattimagga),
which removes the fetters of the illusion of the &quot;I,&quot; uncertainty, and attachment to rites and rituals. The second is called the path of the once-returner (sakad&#257;g&#257;m&#299;magga). On this path, the fetters
themselves are not destroyed, but their origins are weakened. The third is the path of the non-returner (an&#257;g&#257;m&#299;magga), which destroys the fetters of sensual desire and hostility. The fourth is the path of arhatship
(arahattamagga), which destroys the remaining fetters: the desire to become in the world of form and the formless world, conceit, restlessness and ignorance. Each path is accompanied by a few moments of a special supramundane
experience called fruition (phala). This experience has four stages, according to the paths. Fruition means the feeling of freedom from vice, achieved thanks to the path traveled. This is the state of liberation or tangible
freedom that arises when the fetters that bind a person are destroyed.</p>
<p class="tm54">It was stated earlier that the Dhamma is the real refuge. In the light of the above discussion, this conclusion can be clarified. The teaching conveyed in words is actually a map, a collection of instructions
and recommendations. Since we have to rely on them to reach the goal, the teaching is indeed a real refuge, but only in a derivative sense. Therefore, we can call it a true, but at the same time, indirect refuge. The mundane
path is direct because it is the one to be practiced. But since the main purpose of the mundane path is to attain the supramundane, its role [as a refuge] will be temporary. Therefore, the mundane path should be considered
a real and direct, but temporary refuge. The supramundane path is the harbinger of Nibbana. Once achieved, it leads irreversibly to the goal, so it can be called the true, direct and supreme refuge. However, even the supramundane
path is a conditioned phenomenon, having the property of impermanence, like everything conditioned. Moreover, being a means to an end, it is valuable only as a means, without any value in itself. Therefore, it cannot be considered
the highest refuge. The highest refuge can only be considered the goal of the practice itself - the unconditioned state of Nibbana, which among the three refuges is real, immediate, best and final. It is the best shelter,
an island of safety, a refuge that provides complete protection from the fears and dangers of existence in Samsara.</p>
<h2><strong><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">3. Sangha</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">On the mundane or worldly level, Sangha means the community of monks (Bhikkhu-Sa&#7749;gha). It is a community of people governed by strictly defined rules. The opportunity to become a member of the Sangha
is open to anyone who meets the required standards. To join this community, one only needs to undergo an ordination ceremony according to the rules described in the Vinaya, the code of monastic discipline.</p>
<p class="tm38">Despite the formal nature of the community, it performs the invaluable work of preserving and spreading the Buddha&#39;s teaching. Through the unbroken lineage of teachings, the Sangha has served as the guardian
of the Dhamma for 2,500 years. The way of life it provides enables the Sangha to carry out this task. As we noted earlier, the Buddha&#39;s teaching has two aspects: it is the path of practice that leads to liberation from
suffering, and it is the body of religious doctrine contained in the scriptures that provides a detailed description of the path. The Sangha takes on the responsibility of preserving both. Its members accept the burden of
maintaining a tradition of practice that shows that the goal is attainable and liberation is possible. They also preserve the teachings by ensuring that the sermons and instructions given to the laity are free from distortion
and misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="tm38">For these reasons, the Sangha in the form of a public institution is vital for the preservation of the Buddha&#39;s teaching. However, the community of monks is not in itself the Sangha as the third component
of the refuge. The Sangha as a refuge is not a public institution, but an informal set of followers uniting all those who have comprehended the deep essence of the Buddha&#39;s teaching. The Sangha as a refuge is a wonderful
community consisting only of noble personalities, that is, people of a high spiritual level. The people who enter it are connected to each other not by formal membership, but by an invisible thread of inner self-realization.
To automatically enter this community, one only needs to achieve that very realization.</p>
<p class="tm38">For attaining the level of a noble person, the way of life established for members of the monastic community, which places the main emphasis on renunciation and meditation, is more suitable. However, the Sangha
of monks and the Sangha of noble ones are different concepts. Their meaning is different for two reasons. Firstly, many monks (the vast majority) are ordinary people (puthujjana) and therefore cannot serve as a refuge. Secondly,
lay people can also join the Sangha of noble persons. Membership in it depends solely on achievements in spiritual practice, and not on receiving monastic ordination. Any person (lay or monk) who has come to know the teaching
of the Buddha through direct knowledge automatically enters it at the moment of this achievement. [ <span class="tm28">2 </span>]</p>
<p class="tm38">The Sangha of the Nobles consists of eight types of individuals, which can be divided into four pairs. The first pair are those who are on the path to stream entry and have already entered it. They have entered
the path of liberation and will achieve their goal in no more than seven lifetimes. The second pair are those who are on the path of single return and are once-returners. These beings will return to the human world once before
achieving their goal. The third pair are those who are on the path of non-return and are non-returners. They will not be reborn in the human world and will achieve the final goal in the pure heavenly world. The fourth pair
are those who are on the path to the state of Arhat and have achieved this state. Beings at the level of Arhat have destroyed all vices and are freed from the 10 fetters that bind one to Samsara.</p>
<p class="tm38">There is another way of dividing these eight types of persons into two classes. The first consists of beings who, having understood the teaching, have entered upon the supramundane path to liberation, but who
still need to practice to attain it. These include the first seven noble persons, who are called &quot;students&quot; (sekha) because they are still in the process of learning. The second class includes the Arhats, who have
completed their practice upon attaining the final goal. They are called &quot;graduates&quot; (asekha) because they have successfully completed all the necessary practice.</p>
<p class="tm59">Both students and arhats have gained direct knowledge of the true meaning of the Buddha&#39;s teaching through their own experience. The teaching has taken root in them, and however long the remaining part
of the path may be, they no longer depend on others to reach its end. Because of this inner capacity, these individuals possess the qualities necessary to lead others to the final goal. This means that the community of noble
ones (ariyasa&#7749;gha) can serve as a refuge.</p>
<h2 class="tm61"><strong><a id="aheading_h_q6qneynmhpje"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">IV. The Act of Taking Refuge</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">To enter the &quot;door&quot; of the Buddha&#39;s teaching, it is not enough to simply know the objects of refuge. The &quot;door&quot; to enter the teaching is to take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
Understanding the objects and actually taking them as refuge are two different things. Only taking refuge makes one a follower of the Buddha&#39;s teaching.</p>
<p class="tm38">But what does this procedure consist of? At first glance, it might seem that taking refuge is a formal expression of commitment to the Three Jewels, contained in the words spoken on the occasion, because it
is this act that signifies acceptance of the Buddha&#39;s teaching. However, this view is too superficial. The scriptures say that true taking refuge involves much more than simply uttering a set phrase. It is said that simultaneously
with the utterance of the words, a special, deeply personal spiritual process takes place. This process is the development of a mental commitment to refuge.</p>
<p class="tm38">The commentaries say that taking refuge actually occurs in one&#39;s consciousness: &quot;It is an act done in one&#39;s consciousness, undefiled by vices, based on confidence and reverence in the Three Jewels,
accepting them as the supreme refuge.&quot;[ <span class="tm28">3 </span>] The words &quot;undefiled by vices&quot; emphasize the need for sincerity and purity of intention. Refuge is defiled if it is taken not from a pure
heart, but out of a desire for fame, recognition, or fear of blame. The only proper motivation for taking it is confidence and reverence in the Three Jewels. The act done in one&#39;s consciousness arises from confidence and
reverence, &quot;accepting the Three Jewels as the supreme refuge&quot; (par&#257;yana). Accepting the Three Jewels as the &quot;supreme refuge&quot; means that one recognizes them as the only source of liberation. By turning
to the Three Jewels with this attitude, one turns taking refuge into an act of adoration and self-discovery. We lay down our defenses before the objects of refuge and open ourselves to their help. We lay down our ego and notion
of self-sufficiency and reach out to the objects of refuge, trusting that they can lead us to liberation from confusion, disorder, and suffering.</p>
<p class="tm38">Like any other conscious act, taking refuge is a complex process with many factors. These factors can be divided into three faculties: intellect, will, and emotion. To further clarify the act itself, we will
examine the mental process behind the external manifestations of taking refuge. By examining this process from the perspective of the aforementioned faculties, we will also clarify the contribution that each of them makes.
In other words, we will analyze taking refuge as an act of intellect, will, and emotion.</p>
<p class="tm38">Before we begin, a word of caution is in order. There is much more hidden behind each concrete phenomenon than can be directly seen even by the most profound investigation. For example, a seed has a much deeper
meaning than the material object that is immediately visible to the eye. On the one hand, it contains the entire history of the trees that brought it into being. On the other, it points to the many future trees hidden within
its shell. Similarly, the process that takes place in consciousness when taking refuge is a vast web of diverse forces, stretching forward, backward, and in all directions. It is also woven from many different &quot;threads&quot;
of experience that have reached out from the misty past and intersected at one point. In addition, this web also contains the potential for future threads of development that are only just beginning to emerge within its present
contents. This applies both to the act of taking refuge as a whole and to each of its constituent parts, that is, both must be considered as manifestations in the present, with a vast history of the past and future hidden
from us. Therefore, everything that results from the analysis of this act must be perceived only as a particle among what is implied by its initial premises and its evolution in the future.</p>
<p class="tm38">A first glance at taking refuge immediately makes us realize that it is an act based on understanding. Although reverence and trust lead one to do it, the act itself should not be done blindly, that is, an
intellectual sensitivity is needed to protect the taking of refuge from the dangers of reckless sensual impulses. Intellect guides this act toward the realization of one&#8217;s inner aspiration for liberation. It enables
one to distinguish the ultimate goal from the pitfalls of the path and keeps the follower from the temptation to stray from the ultimate goal in pursuit of the gratification of fleeting desires. It turns out that it is for
this very reason that Right Understanding comes first in the formulation of the Noble Eightfold Path. To follow the path, we must know where it comes from and where it leads and the steps that must be taken to move from one
point to another.</p>
<p class="tm38">Before taking refuge, our intellect already has some awareness of the unsatisfactory nature of all existence, which makes it necessary to rely on something that can give us protection. Suffering should be considered
an inherent characteristic of our existence, poisoning it at its very source. It is impossible to eradicate suffering with weak remedies that only provide temporary relief. Success is achieved only through thorough and deep
treatment. We must look deeper and understand that the cause of our dissatisfaction and discontent is hidden in ourselves, in our attachment, craving and delusion. To be free from suffering, it is necessary to undergo a course
of treatment that destroys its causes.</p>
<p class="tm38">It is necessary to fix in one&#39;s mind the reliability of the objects of refuge. Absolute confidence in the ability of the teaching to lead us to liberation can only arise later, with the attainment of the
[supra-mundane] path. But at the very beginning of the practice, it is necessary to develop a meaningful conviction that the objects of refuge are fully capable of helping us. To do this, one should examine the qualities of
the Buddha, using information about his life and character. Then one should examine his teaching for contradictions and inconsistencies. Finally, one should become familiar with the Sangha to see whether it is worthy of trust
and confidence. Only if they satisfy all these conditions can these objects of refuge be considered reliable helpers in achieving the final goal.</p>
<p class="tm38">The human intellect is involved not only in the initial decision to take refuge, but in the entire process of spiritual practice. Increased depth of understanding leads to ever firmer commitment to the objects
of refuge, and this process in turn stimulates the growth of understanding itself. The culmination of cultivation in these two directions is the attainment of the supramundane path. When attained, this path reveals the truth
behind the teaching, and commitment to the objects of refuge becomes unshakable, having been verified through personal experience.</p>
<p class="tm38">Taking refuge is also an act of the will. It is accomplished through a voluntary decision without coercion or pressure from others. One makes this choice &quot;without coercion from others&quot; (aparappaccaya).
This voluntary act brings about a far-reaching reorganization of one&#39;s aspirations. Whereas previously one&#39;s attention was absorbed by a multitude of interests and concerns, from the moment of taking refuge the aspirations
become ordered and concentrated by this new object of devotion. A new ideal is placed at the center of one&#39;s spiritual life, displacing lesser concerns and placing everything else in a subordinate position in relation
to itself. In this way, taking refuge harmonizes one&#39;s system of values, which rise and unite in a strong aspiration for liberation that guides all activities.</p>
<p class="tm38">There is also a profound change in the direction of the will. Before taking refuge, it is drawn outward, seeking to expand the boundaries of its self-importance. The will seeks to enlarge the space for the
ego by expanding the range of what is owned, controlled, or subordinated. A person who takes refuge in the Buddha&#39;s teaching lays the foundation by which this force can be weakened and turned back. The Buddha teaches that
the desire to expand the space for the ego is the cause of our bondage. It is a manifestation of craving, passion, and attachment, leading directly to disappointment and despair. When this understanding comes, a person realizes
the danger of selfish striving, and his will turns in the opposite direction, toward renunciation and non-attachment. Gradually, interest in the objects of attachment disappears, and the concepts of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;
are no longer associated with what they were previously associated with. The understanding comes that the final liberation lies not in expanding one&#39;s ego to infinity, but in the complete destruction of the illusion of
its existence.</p>
<p class="tm38">The third aspect of taking refuge is emotional. Although the act itself requires more than a mere emotional impulse, it cannot produce results without the forward momentum of the emotions. Three feelings are
involved in the act of taking refuge: confidence, reverence, and love. Confidence (pas&#257;da) is a feeling of serene trust in the ability of the objects of the threefold refuge to provide protection, based on a clear understanding
of their qualities and functions. Confidence gives rise to reverence (g&#257;rava), a feeling of admiration, respect, and veneration that arises from a growing understanding of the excellence and greatness of the Three Jewels.
However, this reverence is not cold, formal, or distant. As we sense how the Dhamma is transforming our lives, we begin to experience the awakening of love (pema). Love adds warmth and vitality to spiritual practice. It ignites
the flame of commitment, finding expression in the form of purposeful service, through which we strive to extend to others the protective and liberating power of the threefold refuge.</p>
<h2 class="tm50"><strong><a id="aheading_h_o6t1jrkm2fs"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">V. The Purpose of Taking Refuge</a></u></strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">Taking refuge is the door to the Buddha&#39;s teaching. According to the teaching, it is the starting point for all types of Buddhist spiritual practice. In order to properly begin a practice, one must enter
it through the door of taking refuge, just as we must enter through the door of a restaurant when we go to have lunch. If you simply stood on the street and read the menu through the glass, you would still remain hungry, even
though you now have a thorough knowledge of the menu of dishes served in that restaurant. In the same way, if we simply study and revere the Buddha&#39;s teaching, we cannot be considered to be practicing it. Even if we practice
individual elements in our daily life without first taking refuge, this cannot be considered to be truly following the Buddha&#39;s teaching. In this case, we are doing things in accordance with or in accordance with the teaching,
but since they are not accompanied by the feeling of having taken refuge in the Three Jewels, they cannot be called Buddhist practice.</p>
<p class="tm38">To illustrate the importance of taking refuge, we will compare two people. One scrupulously observes the principles laid down in the five precepts of moral conduct (pa&ntilde;cas&#299;la). He has not formally
accepted these precepts according to Buddhist custom, but unconsciously follows the norms of conduct laid down in them through his own sense of skillfulness and unskillfulness. That is, he observes them as generally accepted
moral norms. Let us also assume that he meditates for several hours a day, but regards this not as a practice of Dhamma, but as a means of achieving peace of mind here and now. We can also assume that this person is already
familiar with the Buddha&#39;s teaching. But although he respects and values this teaching highly, his conviction is not so strong as to recognize the Dhamma as true or to feel the need to take refuge.</p>
<p class="tm38">Now let us imagine another person who is in a situation where it is impossible to observe the rules of conduct to the last detail and who has no free time to practice meditation. But in the absence of these
achievements, he has taken refuge in the Three Jewels wholeheartedly, sincerely, meaningfully, and with a clear goal in mind. Comparing these two people, we may ask ourselves whose attitude is more valuable in terms of spiritual
development in the long term? Is it the attitude of the first person who has not taken refuge, but who observes the principles of the Five Precepts and meditates for several hours a day? Or is the attitude of the second person,
who cannot follow all of this perfectly, but has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, more valuable? The suttas and commentaries do not give a clear explanation on this matter, but we have enough information on
which to base our reasoning. Based on these, we can conclude that the attitude of the second person, who has sincerely taken refuge based on a clear understanding of this act, has greater spiritual value in the long term.
This conclusion can be made on the following basis.</p>
<p class="tm38">As a result of following the rules and meditating, the first person will experience peace and happiness in this life and accumulate merits leading to a favorable rebirth in the future. However, when the accumulated
merits manifest, they may eventually be exhausted and their power will cease to act, never leading to further spiritual development. When the favorable rebirth achieved through merit comes to an end, another rebirth follows,
in accordance with the accumulated karma. That is, the person will continue to wander in the cycle of life. His skillful actions cannot directly help in the matter of liberation from the circle of Samsara.</p>
<p class="tm38">But the second person, who does not have the opportunity to thoroughly engage in all kinds of practice, but who sincerely takes refuge in the Three Jewels, creates the basis for spiritual progress in future
lives through this one act. Of course, he will have to experience the results of accumulated karma, which cannot be avoided simply by taking refuge. But this act, having become the true center of a person&#8217;s spiritual
life, is in itself a powerful skillful karma. It will be an invisible thread connecting with the Buddha&#8217;s teaching in future lives, increasing the chances of attainment in the future. Even if such a person fails to attain
liberation during the time that the teaching of Buddha Gotama exists, surely this invisible thread will lead him to subsequent Buddhas, and so on until he reaches the final goal. Since all these benefits spring from the seed
of sincerely taking refuge, we understand the extremely great significance of this act.</p>
<p class="tm59">The importance of taking refuge can also be emphasized by the analogy of faith as a seed. Since faith is what moves one to take refuge, the analogy can be applied to the act itself. We explained earlier that
three factors are involved in the intellect in taking refuge: understanding, will, and emotion. These factors are also present in the initial process of seeking refuge, existing there as seeds with the potential to grow into
the flowers and fruits of Buddhist spiritual practice. The understanding that leads one to take refuge, the understanding of the dangers and horrors of existence in Samsara, is the seed for the wisdom factor, which then grows
into direct knowledge of the four noble truths. The will element serves as the seed of the desire for renunciation, which is the driving force that pushes one to renounce desires, pleasures, and selfish attachments in order
to become a monk in search of liberation. It also serves as the seed for the practice of Right Effort, the sixth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, which we practice to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop pure and
skillful ones. Devotion and reverence for the Three Jewels become the seeds for &#8220;unshakable confidence&#8221; (aveccappasada) &#8211; the confidence of the noble disciple whose confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha
cannot be shaken by any external force. In this way, the simple act of taking refuge serves as the threefold seed for developing the higher qualities of right understanding, right effort and unshakable confidence. From this
very example, we again understand how important this act is.</p>
<h2 class="tm50"><strong><a id="aheading_h_hi8ejj6z9xa"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">VI. Methods of Taking Refuge</a></u></strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">There are two ways of taking refuge: the highest or supramundane and the ordinary or mundane. Supramundane taking refuge is the act of a person of high spiritual level, that is, a noble follower who has attained
the supramundane path that leads irreversibly to Nibbana. When such a person takes refuge in the Three Jewels, his act is the highest, unshakable and invincible. A noble person cannot, for the rest of his lives (not more than
seven), take refuge in any teacher other than the Buddha, in any teaching other than the Dhamma, or in any religious community other than the Sangha. The Buddha said that such a follower&#39;s confidence in the Three Jewels
is so firm and unshakable that no one in the universe can shake it.</p>
<p class="tm38">The usual way of taking refuge in the Three Jewels is performed by ordinary people, that is, by the overwhelming majority who have not yet attained the state of a noble person. This taking of refuge in turn
can be of two types - initial and regular.</p>
<p class="tm38">The initial taking of refuge occurs when a person first undergoes the formal refuge ceremony. Having studied the basic principles of the Buddha&#39;s teaching and having begun to engage in some forms of Buddhist
spiritual practice, a person comes to understand the benefits of this teaching for himself. In this case, he may want to express his commitment by performing the appropriate ritual. Strictly speaking, a person takes refuge
in the Three Jewels precisely at the moment when, on the intellectual level, he recognizes the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha as his guiding ideals and as a result becomes a lay Buddhist (upasaka, upasika). However, in the Buddhist
tradition, it is considered insufficient under normal circumstances to take refuge on a purely mental level. If a person is truly convinced of the truth of the Buddha&#39;s teaching and wants to follow it, then, if possible,
it is desirable to undergo the refuge ritual according to the established Buddhist tradition. This means receiving the three refuges from a fully ordained Buddhist monk of good standing in the Sangha.</p>
<p class="tm57">If you decide to perform this ceremony, you will need to find a qualified monk, who may be your spiritual mentor or any other respected member of the Community. You should discuss your intentions with him and
make the necessary preparations for the ritual. On the appointed day, you should go to the temple or monastery, bringing offerings such as candles, incense, flowers for the place of worship, and a small gift for the monk with
whom you have arranged. While making the offerings in the presence of the mentor, you should place your palms together at your chest, thus making a gesture of respect (a&ntilde;jali), bow three times to the image of the Buddha,
and pay homage to the Three Jewels, represented by the images and symbols of the temple. Then, kneeling before the place of worship, you should ask the monk for the three refuges. The monk will say, &quot;Repeat after me,&quot;
and recite the following phrase:</p>
<p class="tm63">
<img src="tisaranaBoEn_&#1092;&#1072;&#1081;&#1083;&#1099;/img00001.PNG" width="953" height="515" hspace="12" vspace="12" alt="" /></p>
<p class="tm52">You should repeat after him line by line. At the end of the ceremony, the monk will say: Sara&#7751;agamana&#7747; sampunna&#7747; (&quot;taking refuge is complete&quot;). At this point, one formally becomes
a follower of the Buddha and continues to be so as long as the refuge is not broken. But to make the refuge especially strong and clear, one can confirm its acceptance by answering the monk as follows: &quot;Venerable sir,
please regard me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from now on and for the rest of my life.&quot; This is said to declare one&#39;s determination to be committed to the three refuges as an ideal guiding the way for the
rest of one&#39;s life. After the refuge ceremony, the monk will usually give the lay follower the five training rules. These are the norms of moral conduct that consist of abstaining from taking life, stealing, sexual immorality,
lying, and intoxicants. We will look at them in Part II.</p>
<p class="tm38">By first undergoing the formal ceremony of taking refuge, one openly declares one&#39;s adherence to the Buddha&#39;s teaching, becoming a self-proclaimed follower. However, taking refuge should not be a once-in-a-lifetime
event that is then forgotten over time. It is, in fact, a means of development and inner improvement that should be undertaken regularly, repeated over and over again, as part of a daily routine. Just as we wash our faces
every morning to keep our bodies clean, we should take care of our minds by daily placing a seed in them for progress along the path of Buddhist practice. This seed is taking refuge. It is advisable to do this twice a day,
reciting all nine lines each time. But if taking refuge twice a day is not possible, then we should find time to recite the lines at least once a day.</p>
<p class="tm38">The daily refuge recitation is best done in a designated room or at a home shrine with an image of the Buddha. The recitation may be preceded by offerings of candles, incense, or flowers. After making the offerings,
one should bow three times to the image of the Buddha and, remaining kneeling, place one&#39;s hands together at the chest (a&ntilde;jali). Before reciting the refuge recitation, it is helpful to visualize the Three Jewels
to which they are addressed, so that a sense of their actual presence next to oneself arises. The Buddha can be visualized by remembering a beautiful picture or statue of him. Imagine that in front of the Buddha&#39;s image
there are three volumes of scriptures representing the Tipitaka, a collection of Buddhist teachings. They symbolize the Dhamma, the second object of refuge. It can also be symbolized by the &quot;wheel of Dhamma&quot; (dhammacakka)
with eight spokes, symbolizing the Noble Eightfold Path. All the spokes converge at the axis of the wheel, which represents Nibbana. The Dhamma wheel should be bright and beautiful, radiating golden light. To represent the
Sangha, one can imagine the two senior disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana, standing on either side of the Buddha. In addition, the Sangha can be symbolized by a group of monks who have followed the teaching and achieved the
state of Arhat, in which all vices are completely destroyed and perfect liberation is achieved.</p>
<p class="tm59">Developing faith and confidence, holding all the visualized objects in your imagination, you should recite the refuge verses three times with feeling and conviction. If you are practicing meditation, it is
important to recite these words before you begin, because they help you maintain a sense of purpose in the midst of all the obstacles you may encounter on the path. For this reason, those who are beginning intensive meditation
practice in a solitary place do not begin with the usual refuge verses, but with the following phrase: &quot;Aha&#7747; att&#257;na&#7747; Buddhassa niyyatemi Dhammassa Sa&#7749;ghassa&quot; - &quot;I surrender myself into
the hands of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.&quot; By surrendering yourself and your life into the hands of the Three Jewels, the devotee protects yourself from the obstacles that may arise on the path and guards yourself against
selfish attachment to the attainments you may achieve. But this version of taking refuge should not be taken lightly, because its consequences are very serious. In ordinary cases, the standard version should be used for daily
practice.</p>
<h2 class="tm50"><strong><a id="aheading_h_gz1favovrsu0"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">VII. Distortions and violation of refuge</a></u> </strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">Distortions of refuge are factors that make taking refuge defiled, insincere and ineffective. The commentaries say that there are three such factors: ignorance, doubt and wrong views. If one does not understand
the reason for taking refuge, its meaning or the qualities of the Three Jewels, this lack of knowledge is a form of ignorance that distorts the act from within. Doubt defiles refuge because the person affected by it cannot
have firm confidence in the Three Jewels. His commitment is tainted by confusion, suspicion and indecision. Wrong views are a mistaken understanding of the act of taking refuge or misconceptions about the Three Jewels. A person
with wrong views takes refuge thinking that the act itself will guarantee him liberation. He may believe that the Buddha is a god who can save him, that the Dhamma contains the doctrine of the eternal soul, or that the Sangha
is the intercessor for men through whom salvation is granted. However, even if the taking of refuge is distorted by these factors, a person will become a Buddhist and his refuge will be valid as long as he regards the Three
Jewels as his supreme refuge. But although this refuge is valid, the person&#39;s attitude towards taking it is faulty and needs correction. This correction can be made if he meets a qualified teacher who will give the necessary
guidance and help him overcome ignorance, doubts and wrong views.</p>
<p class="tm38">Breaking the refuge means giving up the three aspects of it. It occurs when a person who has taken refuge comes to regard something other than the Three Jewels as his ideal or support. If he comes to regard
someone as superior to the Buddha or as a more authoritative spiritual teacher than the Buddha, that person&#8217;s refuge in the Buddha becomes invalid. If he comes to regard another teaching as better than the Dhamma or
resorts to another system of practice to attain liberation, that person&#8217;s refuge in the Dhamma becomes invalid. If he comes to regard any community of noble persons other than the Sangha as possessing supramundane attainments
or as being on a higher level, that person&#8217;s refuge in the Sangha becomes invalid. For taking refuge to be valid and uncorrupted, one must recognize the Three Jewels as the only means to attain final liberation: &#8220;There
is no other refuge for me. Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are my supreme refuge.&#8221;</p>
<p class="tm59">Breaking one&#39;s commitment to even one jewel invalidates commitment to all the others, because the functioning of refuge requires recognition of the interconnectedness and inseparability of all three of
its components. Therefore, by taking anything other than the Three Jewels as one&#39;s highest support, one breaks one&#39;s refuge in them and renounces one&#39;s status as a follower of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. For
refuge to become valid, one must take it anew, preferably by first acknowledging one&#39;s transgression, and then undergoing the formal ceremony from beginning to end.</p>
<h2><strong><a id="aheading_h_5k3kvld7rxun"></a><u><a href="#aheading_h_brtoc0obrb">VIII. Analogies illustrating the objects of refuge</a></u></strong></h2>
<p class="tm38">According to the traditional Indian way of presenting ideas, an explanation cannot be considered complete until it is illustrated by analogies. We will therefore conclude our discussion of taking refuge with
classical analogies of its objects. Although the Buddhist texts contain many excellent analogies, for the sake of brevity we will limit ourselves to four.</p>
<p class="tm38">In the first analogy, the Buddha is compared to the Sun, because his appearance in our world is like the rising of the daylight from behind the horizon. His true teaching (Dhamma) is like the many rays that
spread across the Earth, dispelling the darkness and cold of the night, giving warmth and light to all. The Sangha is like those beings who, seeing that the darkness has dissipated, begin to go about their business, enjoying
the warmth and light of the Sun.</p>
<p class="tm38">In the second analogy, the Buddha is compared to the full moon, the queen of the night sky. The Dhamma is like the moonlight that shines on the earth, providing coolness after the heat of the day. The Sangha
are the people who go out at night to enjoy the refreshing beauty of the moonlight.</p>
<p class="tm38">In the third analogy, the Buddha is compared to a great cloud that comes to the countryside at a time when the earth is parched by the summer sun. The true teaching contained in the Dhamma is the pouring streams
of rain that fill the earth with water and nourish human crops and all other plants. The Sangha is like the plants &#8211; trees, shrubs and grass &#8211; that grow and blossom thanks to the nourishment of the rain that falls
on them from the cloud.</p>
<p class="tm57">The fourth analogy compares the Buddha to a lotus flower, a symbol of beauty and purity. Just as a lotus grows in a muddy lake and emerges to the surface in all its beauty, untainted by dirt, so the Buddha,
having grown up in this world, transcends it and lives untainted by its vices. The Buddha&#39;s Dhamma is like the delicious fragrance emanating from the lotus flower, which brings pleasure to all. The Sangha is here compared
to many bees that flock to the flower for nectar, and then fly to their hives, where the nectar becomes honey.</p>
