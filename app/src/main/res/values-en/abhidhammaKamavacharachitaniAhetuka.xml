        UNBENEFITABLE RESULTING CONSCIOUSNESS (akusalavipākacittāni): \n
        The first category of rootless consciousness contains seven types of consciousness,
        which are the results of unwholesome kamma. These seven types
        consciousnesses in themselves are not considered unwholesome;
        they are kamma indefinite (abyākata). The word "unwholesome"
        (akusala) here means that they are the results produced by unwholesome kamma.
        In this case, akusala characterizes not these states of consciousness themselves,
        but the kamma from which they originated.
    </string>
    <string name="textDiscribeAhetukaWholsomeResult">
        Beneficial Resulting Rootless Consciousness (kusalavipāka-ahetukacittāni): \n
The eight types of consciousness in this category are the results of wholesome kamma. The word ahetuka was not included in the previous class designation because all unwholesome resultants are rootless—there are no unwholesome resultants accompanied by roots. However,
as will be seen later, beneficial results can
be accompanied by roots, namely beautiful roots,
being kammically indefinite (abyākata). \n \n
In order to distinguish beneficial resultants,
who have no roots, from those who have roots, the word ahetuka was introduced into the designation of their class. \n \n
Seven consciousnesses from all rootless types of consciousness correspond to unwholesome resultants. But while unwholesome resultants arise in relation to an undesirable object, wholesome resultants
arise in relation to an object that is desirable (ittha) or extremely desirable (ati-ittha). \n \n
The first four sensory consciousnesses here, like their unwholesome twins, are associated with calmness, that is, a neutral feeling; however, due to the fact that the object has a [comparatively] stronger effect on the body,
the feeling associated with the beneficial resultant consciousness of the body is bodily pleasure (sukha). \n \n
Beneficial resultant rootless consciousnesses
include one type of consciousness that has no correspondence
among the unwholesome resultants. It is an exploring consciousness accompanied by joy (somanassa).
While the inquiring consciousness arising from unwholesome kamma is always accompanied by a neutral feeling, the inquiring consciousness arising from wholesome kamma is binary - one is accompanied by a neutral feeling and arises in the case of a moderately desirable object, the other is accompanied by joy and arises in the case of a particularly desirable object . So in this
class has eight types of consciousness, in contrast to the previous class, which contains seven types.</string>
    <string name="textDiscribeAhetukaFunktion">
        ROOTELESS FUNCTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS (ahetukakiriyachittāni): \n
         The remaining three types of consciousness among the Ahetukas are not kammic results.
         They belong to a category called qiriya, translated here as
"functional" to indicate what they do
tasks that do not have kammic potential. Such
types of consciousness are neither kamma-producing nor
the results of kamma. In this category, three types of consciousness are rootless,
         the rest (described below) have roots.

         One more consciousness must first arise. It is the consciousness that directs to the five
         touch doors, which has the function of direction (āvajjana) to any object,
         imagining himself at one of the five sensory doors (dvāra).

In each case it performs a different function. When it happens in the process at five doors, it is called
votthapanacitta - "determining consciousness." In that
case its function is to define or determine
an object that has been known by sensory consciousness. In the process at the five doors, the determining consciousness follows
behind the exploring consciousness. After the investigating consciousness has studied the object, the determining consciousness recognizes
his.
         In the mind-door process - the mental process that
carried out through the internal ability to think - this same type of consciousness performs a different function. His
the function in this case is to provide direction to the object,
