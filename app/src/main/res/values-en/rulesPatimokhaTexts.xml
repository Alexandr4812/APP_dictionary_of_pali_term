    <string name="textAboutSanghadisesa"> \n Sanghadisesa \n \n This term means [violation] "involving the participation of the Community in the primary (adi) and subsequent (sesa) procedures". \n It follows from the fact that in case of violation of any of the rules of this class, it is the Community that initially imposes punishment on the monk (including a redemptive period and a probation period), imposes it again if the monk has not fulfilled the established requirements, and when the monk has fulfilled all the requirements, removes the punishment from him.   \n  This section contains 13 rules, in the case of the first nine, the monk is credited with a violation immediately after the offense is committed, in the last four only after the offender has been reprimanded three times in the form of a Community procedure.  \n  \n  \n  \n</string>
    <string name="buttonTextAboutParajika">about the rules of parajiki</string>
    <string name="textAboutParajika">\n Parajika (defeat) \n \n The book Parivara says that this term comes from a verb meaning to lose or to be defeated. A monk who commits the four prohibited acts described in this chapter is considered to have succumbed to his mental defilements (upakkilesa) to an extent that overpowers his original goal of becoming a monk. The Vibhanga gives a number of metaphors to illustrate the irreversible nature of defeat: like a man with his head cut off like a withered leaf torn from the stem… like a flat stone broken in two, which cannot be united… like a palm tree with its top cut off, unable to continue growth. A monk who commits any of these prohibited acts is irreversibly excommunicated from the life of the monastic community and is no longer considered a monk.</string>

          HISTORY \n \n

While the Tathagata lived in the Jetavana monastery at Savatthi,
Venerable Seyasaka was not happy with his holy life
(brahmachari). As a result, he turned pale and lost weight. Day hon.
Udayi, his mentor, asked why he looked unhappy and
unhealthy. Venerable Seyasaka told Venerable Udain about his problem. Then the Venerable Udayi admonished him thus: “Friend, you
You need to eat as much delicious food as possible, sleep as much as you want, and masturbate whenever you get bored.” Hearing this advice, Venerable Seiyasaka asked Venerable Udain who, perhaps, the monks were guilty of such actions. Venerable Udain told him that this is completely normal and even he himself does it from time to time.
After this, Venerable Seiyasaka, following the advice of his mentor, ate
eating as much delicious food as he could, sleeping well and only masturbating when he got bored. Then his skin color became brighter and his body returned to normal. Noticing this difference, the other monks asked the venerable if he had taken any special medicine for his deteriorating physical condition. Venerable Seyasaka explained to them his secret to improving their health. Hearing this, the monks began to criticize
Venerable Seyasaku and his unworthy behavior, which was not suitable for monks. They asked him: “Do you use the same hand for masturbation with which you drink the food offered to the believers?” Upon learning this news, the Buddha proclaimed a rule prohibiting monks from masturbating. \n \n \n

<i>If any monk under the influence of lust, with a distorted mind, makes bodily contact with a woman, takes her by the hand, by a lock of hair, or caresses other parts of her body, this entails the initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. \n \n</i>
    \n \n

\n \n This rule arose as a result of one event related to the Venerable Udain \n \n
Udain touched the brahman`s wife with lust. This happened when a brahmin and his wife were examining Udain`s kuti. \n \n

The kayasamsagga desire is the desire to touch the body,
living or nonliving. However, the Sanghadisesa will only

         HISTORY OF ORIGIN \n \n
Once the Buddha lived in the Jetavana Monastery in Savatthi.
At that time, Venerable Udayin lived in a forest monastery. His residence (vihara)
was very attractive and beautifully built. In the middle there was a large room.
and there were various storerooms around. Chairs, beds, pillows and rugs are stored in suitable places. The vessels were always filled with water, which could be
used for drinking and other purposes. So people often came to see
This. One day a Brahmin visited the monastery of Venerable Udain along with his wife.
the Brahmins informed the venerable Udain of their desire to see his vihara. Venerable Udayin then opened the doors and windows of his vihara and ushered the couple out. The Brahmin followed Venerable Udain and his wife. Both of them observed the beauty and neatness of the vihara. Venerable Udayi, while showing his vihara to the Brahmin couple, opened and closed some windows and secretly touched the body of the Brahmin`s wife.
Unaware of the immoral act committed by Venerable Udayin, the Brahmin praised him for maintaining such a beautiful vihara. He later praised
Venerable Udayi to his wife. Hearing this, the Brahmin`s wife condemned the venerable Udayin, saying that he touched her limbs while showing his abode. Having learned about the immoral behavior of the Venerable Udayin, the Brahmin began to criticize the first and all Buddhist monks in general. Upon hearing the news, the Buddha announced a teaching rule prohibiting monks from touching women with lustful intentions. \n \n

         OTHER INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT VIOLATIONS \n \n
         1. In case of obscene remarks addressed to a woman, the number of violations will depend on the number of offensive words spoken and the number of women. For example, five insults to the Sanghadises will be considered committed when five insulting words are said to one woman, and also when one insulting word is said to five women. If five insulting words are spoken to five women, twenty-five insults will be committed. \n

         insult to a woman can be committedonly if such words are spoken out of a desire to make obscene remarks. If these words are spoken purely out of anger, there will be no offense to the Sanghadisesa. If a woman (including a bhikkhuni) is scolded in this way out of anger, duccata will be committed according to the rule of omasavada training. \n
         4. Vajirabuddhi Tika states that, according to some famous scholars, the insult of tullacaya
         will be committed for making lewd remarks towards non-human women such as petis and yakchinis. \n \n

         The intention behind the desire to utter a word or make a physical gesture
         associated with female private parts and sexual interaction is known as duthullasada.
         The desire that arises with such an intention is called dutthullassadaraga.
         A violation will be committed if words are spoken out of this desire.
         It should be known that no violation will be committed if women are discussed in the context of preaching the Dhamma.
         intimate body parts or sexual interactions. \n \n

         HISTORY OF OPENING \n \n
         Once the Buddha lived in the Jetavana monastery near Savatthi.
         At that time, Venerable Udain lived in a monastery located in the forest.
         The monastery was very beautiful and attractive. Some women asked Udayn for permission to see his monastery.
         After showing the monastery to the women, Venerable Udain began making obscene remarks using
         in words, intimate parts of the body. He also hinted at having an intimate relationship with him.
         Some bad behaved ladies, among others, laughed at what he said.
         They also responded by making obscene remarks on the words of Venerable Udain.
         The ladies of good behavior did not like what Venerable Udain was doing.
         And they criticized his behavior. Having learned about this, the Buddha proclaimed the rule of learning,
         prohibiting monks from making obscene remarks related to intimate parts of the body. \n \n

        <i> If any monk, under the influence of a lustful mind with a distorted mind,

            how to perform sexual intercourse with me.
            This entails an initial and subsequent community meeting. \n \n </i>

        The rule arose as a result of one event.
         Venerable Udain asked a woman to provide him with sexual favors. \n \n

         FACTORS \n \n
         To break this learning rule, the following elements must be met. \n \n
         1. A female person. \n \n
         2. Know that she is a woman. \n \n
         3. A monk who has a desire for sexual interaction. \n \n
         4. Statement of the benefits of providing sexual services based on this desire. \n \n
         5. The woman instantly understands the words spoken by the monk. \n \n \n \n

         CASES OF VIOLATIONS \n \n
Cases of violations in relation to this training rule are as follows:\n \n
1. When a bhikkhu explains to a woman by words or bodily gestures the benefits of providing sexual favors, knowing that she is a woman, and if the woman instantly understands the words expressed, the bhikkhu will be committing a violation of sanghadises. If the woman does not understand immediately, a tulachaya violation will be committed. \n \n
2. When a monk explains to a woman in words or gestures the benefits of providing sexual services, assuming that the woman is
eunuch, man or animal, or even if the monk is not sure,
the person is a woman or not, and if the woman to whom the words are addressed
If what is said is understood, the monk will commit a tulachaya violation. \n \n
3. When the monk explains to the eunuch in words or gestures,
merit in providing sexual services, knowing that he is a eunuch, and if
a eunuch understands spoken words instantly, a monk
commits a tulachaya violation. If the eunuch doesn`t
understand right away, a violation of the duccat will be committed. \n \n
4. When a monk explains to a eunuch in words or gestures,
the merits of providing sexual services, assuming the eunuch is a woman, a man or an animal, or even if the monk is not sure
Whether a person is a eunuch or not, and if the eunuch to whom the words are spoken understands or does not understand, the offense of duccat will be committed by the monk. \n \n
5. Vajirabuddhi Tika states that according to some scholars, when words of praise for sexual favors are expressed to non-human women, including women from the Yakkha and Peta groups, as well as hermaphrodites, a violation of tullacchaya will be committed. \n \n
6. When a monk explains to a man or any other being other than a woman or a eunuch, by words or bodily gestures, the benefits of providing sexual services, and if he immediately understands or not what was said, the monk will commit a violation of duccat. \n \n
7. If a monk indirectly states the following: “It is appropriate to serve those who live in your monastery through sexual behavior,” this will violate the duccat. \n \n \n \n

         EXAMPLE OF NO VIOLATIONS \n \n
         Cases where there are no violations in relation to this training rule are as follows: \n \n
         1. Civaradihi vatthukamehi paricariyaya vannam bhasantassa - If the merits of serving a monk by offering items such as clothes and alms are declared, this will not result in any offense. \n \n
         2. Ummattakassa \n \n
         3. Hittachittassa \n \n
         4. Vedanatassa\n\n
         5. Adikammikassa \n \n \n \n

         PERCEPTION AND INTENT \n \n
         From the desire for sexual interaction, with the thought:
         “I will expound the merits of providing sexual services to a woman,”
         and if one deliberately praises the provision of sexual services to a woman, a sanghadisesa will be committed.
         Thus, this rule of training is based on intention (sachittaka) and is called sannyavimokkha. \n \n

         IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS TRAINING RULE, A VIOLATION WILL BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE \n \n
If sexual services are praised and this is communicated to a woman who can understand the difference between obscene (dutthulla) and decent (adutthulla) words. Therefore, if the provision of sexual services is praised and told to a woman who does not understand such words, a violation of tullakchaya and not sanghadisesa will be committed. However, if a woman cannot immediately understand what the monk is saying, but understands it in retrospect or through later explanation, a violation of sanghadises will not be committed. This will only amount to tulachchaya.
You can praise the provision of sexual services not only with words, but also with body language, for example, with hand gestures. When such intentions are implied through the body and the woman immediately understands what has been conveyed, sanghadisesa will be committed. \n \n

         ORIGIN STORIES \n \n
         Once the Buddha lived in the Jetavana monastery near Savatthi.
         In those days, Venerable Udain visited various worldly families and maintained very friendly relations with them. A beautiful widow lived in one house.
         One day, the Venerable Udain, having dressed and taking a begging bowl, went to this house.
         Entering the house, he sat down in the place prepared for him. This widow also approached the venerable Udayn,
         She paid him respects and sat down next to him. Venerable Udayi made the widow happy with a conversation about the Dhamma.
         Satisfied, she offered to tell himTell her about your needs in relation to the four necessary things.
         At this invitation Venerable Udain spoke and the following conversation took place between them:
         “Sister, we have enough of everything we need. Please give me something that is rare to get.”
         “What is this?” “Sex.” She then, intending to give Venerable Udayn the opportunity to experience sexual intercourse,
         invited him to her room. She came in earlier, took off her clothes and lay down on the bed. Venerable Udain
         followed her into the room. Approaching the lady, he examined her and insulted her: “Who would touch this
         disgusting and foul-smelling? Then, spitting, he left the room.
         The widow was offended by the action of the venerable Udain. She blamed all the monks in general, saying:
         “How could the monks first ask for sex and then insult me? What is repulsive about me?
         What makes me smell bad? How could he spit and leave with the words: “Who will touch this disgusting
         and smelly? Upon hearing this news, other women also began to criticize the act.
         Venerable Udain. In this regard, the Buddha proclaimed this rule of teaching. \n \n

        <b>Violation under this rule. \n \n</b>

         Because both the Vibhanga and the Commentary define the action of transmission as “telling”:
         makes a gesture or writes a letter - is he committing a violation here?
         Simply carrying a letter without knowing its contents will not
         take into account the effort factor according to this rule. \n \n

         <b>Object: \n \n</b>

         There is no violation for a monk who tries to bring about reconciliation between an estranged couple,
         but not in a divorce, but it would be a complete violation if you try to achieve reconciliation between the couple,
         who is divorced. "Perception" is not a factor here either.
         which prompts the Commentary to note that even an arhat could commit an offense under this rule,
         if he tried to achieve reconciliation between his parents, whom he believed
         were separated when they actually divorced.

         Elsewhere, in a discussion of the five rules, the Commentary includes couples who live as husband and wife,
         without undergoing a formal ceremony in accordance with the definition of marriage, and the same definition,
         apparently applies here too.

         Vibhanga appoints tullacaya as mediator for the pandaka; according to the Commentary,
         the same punishment applies for acting as an intermediary for female yakkha or peta. \n \n

         <b>No offense: \n \n</b>
         Vibhanga argues that, apart from the usual exceptions, it is not a violation,
         if a monk conveys a message from a man to a woman or vice versa concerning “the matter of the community,
         a shrine or a sick person." The commentary illustrates the first two cases with cases
         when a monk conveys a message concerning construction work for a community or shrine;
         and the third case, when a monk, acting on behalf of a sick monk,
         sent by a layman to a laywoman for medicine. \n \n

         The Sub-Commentary adds that any such order,
         i.e. not involving any romantic relationship, is also exempt from punishment,
         unless it is a form of submission to the laity. \n \n
        <b>First sub-story</b> \n \n
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika`s Monastery, Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.
When Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman to the parents of a young man, “The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. She`s suitable for your son.” They would reply, “They don`t know who we are, Venerable. If you could persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son.”
And he praised the young man to the parents of a young woman, “The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. He`s suitable for your daughter.” They would reply, “They don`t know who we are, Venerable, and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl. But if you could persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man.” In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the giving of a bride, and for marriage.
At that time there was a former courtesan who had a beautiful daughter. On one occasion some lay followers of the Ājīvaka religion came from another village and said to that courtesan, “Madam, please give your girl to our boy.”
“I don`t know who you are, Sirs, and I won`t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”
People asked those Ājīvaka lay followers why they had come. They replied, “We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our son, but she refused.”
“But why did you ask the courtesan? You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. He`ll persuade her.”
They then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, we`ve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our son, but she refused. Would you please persuade her to give her daughter?”
Udāyī agreed. Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and said, “Why didn`t you give them your daughter?”
“I don`t know who they are, Sir, and I won`t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”
“Please give her to them. I know them.”
“If you know them, I`ll give her away.”
She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka followers, and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law, but then like a slave.
The girl sent a message to her mother, saying, “Mom, I`m unhappy and miserable. For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law, but then like a slave. Come, mom, and take me home.”
Soon afterwards the courtesan went to those Ājīvakas and said, “Please don`t treat my girl like a slave; treat her properly!”
They replied, “We deal with the monastic, not with you. Go away! We don`t want anything to do with you.” Literally, “We don`t know you.”Being dismissed, she returned to Sāvatthī.
A second time the girl sent the same message to her mother. That courtesan then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, my girl is unhappy and miserable. They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month, but then like a slave. Please tell them to treat her properly.”
Udāyī went to the Ājīvakas and said, “Please don`t treat this girl like a slave; treat her properly.”
They replied, “We deal with the courtesan, not with you. A monastic shouldn`t get involved. You should behave like a proper monastic. So go away! We don`t want anything to do with you.” Being dismissed, he returned to Sāvatthī.
A third time that girl sent the same message to her mother, and a second time the courtesan went to Udāyī and told him the same thing.
He replied, “When I first went, they just dismissed me. Go yourself; I`m not going.”
Then that courtesan complained and criticized him, “May Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy, just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty mother-in-law, father-in-law, and husband.”
The girl, too, complained and criticized him in the same way,
as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands.
But those women who were happy with their in-laws wished him well, saying, “May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well because of our good mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands.”
The monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him well. And the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker?”
They told the Buddha. The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: “Is it true, Udāyī, that you do this?”
“It`s true, Sir.” \n \n
<b>Second sub-story</b> \n \n
Soon afterwards a number of scoundrels who were enjoying themselves in a park sent a messenger to a sex worker, saying, “Please come, let`s enjoy ourselves in the park.”
She replied, “Sirs, I don`t know who you are. I`m wealthy. I don`t want to go outside the city.”
The messenger returned the message. A certain man then said to those men, “Why did you ask the sex worker? You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. He`ll persuade her.”
But a certain Buddhist lay follower said, “No way. That`s not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. He won`t do it.” And they made a bet on whether he would.
Those scoundrels then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, while we were enjoying ourselves in the park, we sent a message to such-and-such a sex worker, asking her to come, but she refused. Would you please persuade her?”
Udāyī agreed. He then went to that sex worker and said, “Why don`t you go to those men?”
She told him why.
“Please go. I know them.”
“If you know them, Sir, I`ll go.” And those men took her to the park.
Then that lay follower complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”
The monks heard it, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”
They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: “Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”
“It`s true, Sir.”

        <b>Origin story</b> \n \n
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
        At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging.
        The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner,
        and were inappropriately large. And since they were never finished,
        the monks kept on begging and asking, “Please give a man, a servant, an ox, a cart,
        a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel; give creepers, bamboo, reeds, grass, clay.”
        I have rendered muñja-reed and pabbaja-reed with the single word “reed”.
        I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.
        People felt oppressed by all the begging and asking,
        so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful.
        They turned away, took a different path, ran off, and closed their doors.
        They even ran away when they saw cows, thinking they were monks.

        <b>Definitions</b> \n \n
By means of begging: \n \n
having himself begged for a man, a servant, an ox, a cart, a machete, a
        hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel; creepers, bamboo, reed, grass, clay.
\n \n A hut: \n \n
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
\n \n Builds: \n \n
building it himself or having it built.
\n \n Without a sponsoring owner: \n \n
there is no other owner, either a woman or a man, either a lay person or one gone forth.
\n \n Intended for himself: \n \n
for his own use.
\n \n It is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long:
measured outside.
\n \n And seven wide inside: \n \n
measured inside.
\n \n He must have monks approve a site: \n \n
the monk who wants to build a hut should clear a site. He should then approach the Sangha,
        arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks,
        squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
“Venerables, I want to build a hut by means of begging, without a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
        I request the Sangha to inspect the site for that hut.” \n \n

        Where harm will be done: \n \n
it is the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, elephants,
        horses, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, or hyenas, or any other animal;
        or it is bordering on a field of grain, a field of vegetables, a place of slaughter,
        a place of execution, a charnel ground, a park, a royal property, an elephant stable,
        a horse stable, a prison, a bar, a slaughterhouse, a street, a crossroads, a public meeting hall,
        or a cul-de-sac—this is called “where harm will be done”.
 \n \n Which lacks space on all sides: \n \n
it is not possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a
        ladder—this is called “which lacks space on all sides”.
 \n \n Where no harm will be done: \n \n
it is not the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes … it is not bordering on …
        a cul-de-sac—this is called “where no harm will be done”.
\n \n Which has space on all sides: \n \n
it is possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around
        it with a ladder—this is called “which has space on all sides”.
\n \n By means of begging: \n \n
having himself begged for a man, a servant … clay.
\n \n A hut: \n \n
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
\n \n Builds: \n \n
building it himself or having it built.
\n \n Or he does not have monks approve the site, or he exceeds the right size: \n \n
if the site for the hut has not been approved through a legal procedure consisting
        of one motion and three announcements, or if he builds a hut or has one built that
        exceeds the allowable length or breadth even by the width of a hair, then
        for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When there is one piece left
        to complete the hut, he commits a serious offense. When the last piece is finished,
        he commits an offense entailing suspension. \n \n
        
        SUGATA SPAN AND SUGATA ELBOW \n \n
SPAND is the distance between the edge of the little finger and the edge of the thumb when the hand and fingers are spread apart. \n
ELBOW is the distance from the elbow to the edge of the middle finger. According to the Theravada Vinaya, there are three types of measures. \n \n
1 Standard Men`s Measures (Pakati Purisa) – Measurements taken according to the body size of a standard man in a society are called Standard Men`s Measures. The span and cubit of such a man are defined as
an ordinary man`s span and elbow. \n \n
2 Average men`s measure (majjhima purisa) - Measures that are one and a half times (x 1 1/2) higher than ordinary men`s measures are called average men`s measures. The span of Majjhima Purish is one and a half times the arm span of Pakati Purish, and the elbow of Majjhima Purish is equal to one and a half times the size of an ordinary male elbow. The middle men`s measures in the commentaries are also known as carpenter`s (vaḍhakī) measures. \n \n
3 Measure of sugata. Measures three times larger than the average male measures are called sugata measures. a span of sugata is equal to three average spans, and a cubit of sugata is equal to three average male cubits. \n \n
The size of the kuti is indicated in sugata arm spans in accordance with the cutikara training rule.
Length of kuti = 12 hand spans sugata = 36 medium hand spans of men = 54 standard hand spans of men. \n \n
Inner width of kuti = 7 sugata hand spans = 21 average man`s hand spans = 31 1/2 standard man`s hand spans. \n \n

         \n \n He commits an offense entailing suspension: \n \n
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. \n \n \n \n

        <b>Origin story</b> \n \n
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery,
        a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him,
        “I`ll have a dwelling built for you, Venerable, if you would find a site for it.”
While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he felled a tree that served as a
        shrine and was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom.
        People complained and criticized him, “How could the Sakyan monastics fell a tree
        that serves as a shrine and is revered by village, town, district, and kingdom?
        They are hurting one-sensed life.”
The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and
        criticized Venerable Channa in the same way.
After rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways, they told the Buddha.
        Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this?
        People perceive trees as conscious. This will affect people’s confidence …” …

        \n \n He commits an offense entailing suspension: \n \n
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. \n \n \n \n

        <b>A complete violation, according to this rule, includes four factors.</b> \n \n
1) Object: another monk, considered a full monk. \n
2) Understanding: the monk perceives him as innocent of the violation of which he is accused. \n
3) Intention: a monk wants to see another monk expelled from the Sangha. \n
4) Effort: The monk makes an unfounded accusation in his presence that he is guilty of violating the parajika class. \n

         Actions that are not violations.
         If one believes the accused to be guilty of parajika and sincerely accuses him based on what he saw, heard or suspects, then, regardless of whether he is guilty or not, one does not commit a violation.
         However, even in such a case, if one makes an accusation without asking the permission of the accused, he takes upon himself dukkata, and pacittiya, if he makes an accusation, to insult him.
         Summary: bringing an unfounded accusation of violating the class of parajika to a monk, in the hope that he will leave the monkhood, is a violation of the class of sanghadises. \n \n

         <b>Origin story</b> \n \n
         At that time, the householder, the owner of delicious food, regularly donated it to the Community, the four monks every day.
         One day he happened to visit the monastery on some business.
         He went to the Venerable Dabba Mallaputta, approaching, he respectfully greeted him and sat aside...
         Venerable Dabba Mallaputta encouraged...his discussion of the Dhamma.
         Then the householder, the owner of the delicious food, ... asked Dabbu Mallaputta: “Who, venerable one, is scheduled to receive the food offering in our house tomorrow?”
         To the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaji (§), householder.
         Mettiya and Bhummajya were among the leaders of the "group of six monks"
         named after the number of leaders notorious for their shameless behavior,
         the instigators of many excesses that forced the Buddha to formulate rules of teaching.
         This upset the householder, the owner of the gourmet food.
         Thinking: “How can these bad monks eat in our house?”, he returned home and ordered his slave:
         “Hey! For those who come for breakfast tomorrow, prepare a mat at the gate and serve them porridge of husked rice with brine.”
         “Yes, master,” answered the slave. At that time the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaji said to each other:
         “Yesterday we were scheduled to have breakfast at the house of the householder, the owner of the gourmet food.
         Tomorrow he will serve us along with his wives and children.
         Some of them will offer us rice, some will offer us curry,
         some will offer us oils, some will offer us seasonings.
         Rejoicing, they were unable to sleep as much as they had planned that night.
         The next day, early in the morning, ... they went to the house of the householder - the owner of the gourmet food.
The slave noticed their approach from afar.
Seeing them, having prepared a mat for them at the gate, she told them: “Sit down, dear ones.”
A thought occurred to the followers of Mettia and Bhummaji: “There is no doubt that the food is not ready yet, that is why we are forced to sit at the gate.”
Then the slave served them porridge from husked rice with brine, saying: “Eat, dear ones.”
"Sister, we are here for a regular meal."
“I know you are here for a regular meal.
But yesterday the householder ordered me: “Hey! For those who come for breakfast tomorrow, prepare a mat at the gate and serve them porridge of husked rice with brine.”
“So eat, dear ones.”
Then the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaji said to each other: “Yesterday a householder, owner of delicious food, came to the monastery and met Dabba Mallaputta.
No doubt Dabba Mallaputta has turned him against us."
Disappointed, they were unable to eat as much as they had planned.
Then... they returned to the monastery and, having put away their chivars and bowls, went outside the gates of the monastery, and having built a canopy from their sangati, they squatted under it (§) - silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, heads bowed, thoughtful, at a loss.
“Then Mettiya bhikkhuni came up to them... and said: “I greet you, dear ones.”
But when she said this, they did not answer.
And for the second time...
And for the third time she said: “I greet you, dear ones.”
And for the third time they did not answer.
"Did I insult you, dear ones?
Why don`t you answer me?"
"Because you, sister, are indifferent while Dabba Mallaputta treats us like dirt."
"What can I do?"
"If you wish, you can persuade the Blessed One to banish Dabba Mallaputta on that very day."
"What can I do?
How can i do this?"
"Go ahead, sister.
Go to the Blessed One and say: “This is inappropriate, Venerable One, and wrong.
A place without fear, without harm, without danger, has now become a place where there is fear, where there is harm, where there is danger.
From where there was calm, a stormy wind is now blowing.
The water seems to be on fire.
I was raped by the respected Dabba Mallaputta."
“As you say, dear ones.”
(And she left to follow their orders)."
This is just the beginning of the story
the origin of this rule, which is one of the longest and most controversial stories of the Vinaya.
After Mettiya Bhikkhuni made her accusation, the Buddha called a meeting of the Sangha to resolve the issue with Venerable Dabba Mallaputta.
He, being one who attained arahantship at the age of seven, answered truthfully that he could not remember ever having indulged in sexual intercourse even in his sleep, much less while awake.
The Buddha then told the Sangha to expel Mettiya Bhikkhuni and interrogate her instigators, after which he returned to his abode.
When the monks expelled her, the followers of Mettia and Bhummaji told them: “Friends, do not expel Mettiya bhikkhuni. She has not done anything wrong.
It was provoked by us, we were upset, unhappy and wanted him to fall."
“Do you mean that you wrongly accused the Venerable Dabba Mallaputta of a parajika class offense?”
"Yes friends".
Then the monks indignantly, and complained, and murmured: “How can the followers of Mettiya and Bhummajī unjustifiably accuse the Venerable Dabba Mallaputta of the offense of the parajika class?” \n \n

         However, for centuries after the canon was compiled, many people became indignant and complained more about the Buddha`s attitude towards Mettiya bhikkhunis.
According to the commentary, her expulsion was one of the controversial issues that separated the Abhayagiri Vihara monks from the Mahavihara monks located in the former capital of Sri Lanka - Anuradhapura.
Even modern scholars have objected to the Buddha`s treatment of Mittiya bhikkhunis in this way and have interpreted this passage as a "monastic interpretation", as if the Buddha himself was not a monk and the entire Canon was not the work of monks and nuns.
The commentary states that the Buddha did this because he knew that if he treated her less harshly, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaji would never reveal that they had incited her to make an accusation, and the truth would never come out.
This would lead some people to secretly believe that Venerable Dabba Mallaputta was guilty and, due to his being an arahant, it would cause them long-term harm and harm. \n \n \n \n \n \n

    Tricks for prosecution in Parajik \n \n

    <b>Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhuṁ duṭṭho doso appatīto aññabhāgiyassa adhikaraṇassa kiñci desaṁ

        koci deso lesamatto upādinno, bhikkhu ca dosaṁ patiṭṭhāti, saṅghādiseso.</b> \n \n

    This rule is almost the same as the previous one and includes the same factors, with the exception of one of the clauses in the "Efforts" section: "unfounded accusation" here becomes "accusation based on a circumstance (adhikaraṇa) relating to another case." The phrase sounds strange, but the origin story provides a perfect example of what it means. \n \n
    The exact difference between the two rules is this: in the case of an unfounded accusation, someone
    did not see that the violation was committed, did not hear or suspect about it;
    or someone changed the status of the evidence, if any, - for example, someone speaks of what he suspected as something he heard, or of what he heard as something he saw.
    In the case of an accusation based on a circumstance related to another matter, someone saw an act that would have been an offense if it had been committed by a monk, and someone does not substitute
    status of evidence, but distorts the facts of the case. \n \n

    <b>Vibhanga lists ten factors that can be used as tricks to misrepresent facts.</b> \n \n

    They are: \n \n
    1. origin (caste),\n
    2. name,\n
    3. clan (family name),\n
    4. physical characteristics\n
    5. misconduct,\n
    6. bowl,\n
    7. robe,\n
    8. mentor,\n
    9. instructor,\n
    10. housing. \n \n

    Considering the way in which Vibhanga illustrates these factors in action, they are divided into two classes:\n
    (1) misconduct,\n
    (2) the remaining nine factors. \n \n

    1) An example of using a misdemeanor as a ploy:\n
    one sees monk Y actually committing a violation.
    Although one perceives this as a lesser offense, he exaggerates the charge to the level of parajika.
    For example, someone sees him getting into an argument with monk Z and, in a fit of anger, striking Z on the head.
    Z loses consciousness, falls to the floor and suffers a severe concussion, which leads to his death.
    Since Y`s intention was simply to hurt Z and not to kill him, he takes upon himself only pacittiya.
    If one realizes the nature of Y`s intention and the fact that the punishment is pacittiya, but still accuses him of committing parajika, one will accept sanghadisesa,
    according to the rule in question.
    For ease of remembering, the use of this trick can be called “one person, another violation.” \n \n

    2) An example of using any of the other nine factors as a trick: X, who may or may not be a monk, has something in common with monk Y - they are both tall, short,
    dark-skinned, fair-haired, they have the same names, they are students of the same mentor, live in the same dwelling, have outwardly similar bowls or robes, etc.
    One sees X performing an action which, if he were a monk, would amount to a parajika violation; on the basis of the similarity between X and monk Y, someone claims to have seen Y performing parajika. For example, X and Y are both very high.
    Late at night, someone sees X and realizes that X is stealing tools from the monastery storeroom.
    Someone has a grudge against Y and therefore accuses him of being a thief, saying:
    "I saw a big tall guy stealing tools and he looked just like you." Surely it was you." \n
    For ease of remembering, the use of this trick can be called “violation of this, the person is different.” \n \n

    None of the texts mention the double trick scenario - that is, "another violation, another person", but judging by the way Vibhanga defines the circumstance pertaining
    to another matter, a double trick would also meet the definition. \n \n

    In other words, if someone who saw X making lustful contact with a woman accuses monk Y, who has the same generic name as X, of having committed sexual intercourse, then the case would seem to fall under this rule.
    A case that does not fall under this rule is based on the fact that someone sees or hears Y doing something that has some resemblance to a violation, but in fact is not one.
    For example, someone overhears the Vinaya instructions that a monk is reading tells some new monks, citing, by way of illustration, some of the statements that may be considered claims to superpowers.
Since this is not a violation, it cannot be what would otherwise be a circumstance (adhikaraṇa) relating to another matter used as a ruse." In shortened terms, this can be called “that person, there are no violations.”
If later, having understood the situation, someone accuses the monk of violating Pr 4, the accusation will be considered unfounded, and thus fall under the previous rule (Sg 8). \n \n

The rest of the explanations of this rule are exactly the same as in the previous rule, except that in the clauses as to what is not an offense, Vibhanga states that if one, either himself or by causing someone else to do so, makes an accusation Based on what one actually perceives as a wrongdoing, there is no wrongdoing, even if the circumstances turn out to be related to another matter. \n
For example, from the examples already given: someone sees X stealing tools in the dark, and, because of his resemblance to Y, actually thinks that Y is the thief.
  Someone sees Y deal a fatal blow to Z and actually believes that Y`s intention was to kill Z.
  In any of these cases, if one accuses Y of violating the class of parajika, he is not committing any violation regardless of how things turned out, although, as in the previous rule, one must be careful to ask Y`s permission before making the accusation, and not have the intention of offending him. \n \n


         HISTORY OF ORIGIN \n \n
         “At that time, the followers of Mettiya and Bhummaji, who were descending from the Vulture Peak mountain, saw a goat copulating with a goat.
When they saw them, they said, “Listen, friends, let us call this goat Dabba Mallaputta, and this goat Mettiya bhikkhuni.
Then we can express ourselves like this: “Before, friends, we accused Dabba Mallaputta of what we heard, but now we have seen with our own eyes how he is fornicating with Mettiya Bhikhuni!” \n \n

         Summary: \n \n
Tampering with evidence to bring charges of violating the parajika class against a monk in the hope that he will leave the monkhood is a violation of the sanghadise class. \n \n \n \n

         HISTORY OF ORIGIN \n \n
Once the Buddha was residing at the Veḷuvana monastery in Rājagaha. On
one occasion, Venerable Devadatta approached monks such as Kokālika
and said thus, “Friends, please join with me. We shall break (cause schism)
Saṅgha order of the Venerable Gotama”. Venerable Kokālik replied, “My
friend, Venerable Gotama possesses great psychic powers, great power and
splendor”. Then Devadatta made the following suggestion; “Friends, we
shall ask for five favors from the Buddha. May monks only use paṃsukūla
robes without accepting robes offered by the lay devotees. May the monks
be forest dwellers their entire life without living in villages or cities. May
monks live only under trees, may they not dwell under shelter of roofs.
May the monks only depend on food accumulated by going for alms round
and may they not accept invitations made by lay devotees for meals. May
monks be vegetarian and may they not consume meat. Venerable Gotama
will surely decline these five favors. After he has declined them, we can
approach the people and convince them to believe in us and not in
Venerable Gotama”. Then Venerable Devadatta approached the Buddha
and asked for the five favors. The Buddha declined the five types of favors
and said that those five practices are optional but not compulsory. Once
the Buddha rejected the five suggestions made by Devadatta, he
approached people and said that the Buddha declined five types of
wholesome practiced suggested by him. Some lay devotees lost the faith
in Buddha and started to follow Venerable Devadatta. Some devotees who
could understand the evil intentions of Devadatta, that is to say cause
schism within the Saṅgha order, criticized his act. Having learned about
Devadattas plot Buddha laid down the saṅghabheda training rule
instructing monks on how to act when another monk is planning to break
the Saṅgha and stop it.

He acts with our consent and approval. He knows , he teaches us, he makes us happy." Then the other monks should warn them in this way: “Do not say that, revered ones. This monk is not an example of the Dharma, not an example of the Vinaya. Do not, revered ones, encourage division in the sangha.

        Factors \n \n
Four elements must be fulfilled in order for an offence to be committed when this
training rule is violated. \n \n
1. Adapting to the likes of the bhikkhu causing schism within the order \n
2. The performance of the samanubhāsanakamma by the Saṅgha in accordance with the Dhamma \n
3. Completing recitation of the kammavācā thrice \n
4. Not abandoning the idea to adapt to the likes of the bhikkhu causing
schism within the order \n \n

        Description of the training rule \n \n
Bhedānuvattaka training rule describes the offence that will be committed by the
bhikkhus who will adapt to supporting the efforts of the bhikkhu who favours
causing schism within the Saṅgha. It also enlightens monks on how to act in order
to prevent a schism. When a certain bhikkhu attempts to cause schism within the
order, bhikkhus who favour his idea and support him, praise him and try to
increase his alliance are called saṅghabhedānuvattaka.
Once aware of such monks, the other bhikkhus must advise them against getting
together with the bhikkhu causing schism within the order. The bhikkhus who do
not do so will commit a dukkaṭa offence. If they do not abandon their following,
when being advised as such, the samanubhāsanakamma must be performed. Even
still, if such ideas are not abandoned, the bhikkhus who are adapted will have
committed a saṅghādisesa offence.
On this occasion, even if there are many bhikkhus who favours causing schism
within the order, the samanubhāsanakamma must be performed at one time for a
maximum of three bhikkhus only. The presence of four or more bhikkhus are
defined as Saṅgha according to Vinaya. If the Saṅgha performs a vinayakamma
for four or more bhikkhus, it would appear as if the Saṅgha performed a
vinayakamma for another group of Saṅgha. Therefore, in a given instance, the
samanubhāsanakamma can only be performed for a maximum of three bhikkhus.
The other information related to this training rule could be understood as
explained under the saṅghabheda training rule. \n \n

        Once the Buddha was residing at the Veḷuvana monastery in Rājagaha.
        During that time, Venerable Devadatta was attempting to cause schism
        between the Saṅgha. One who are virtuous criticized Devadatta for his evil
        acts saying, “Devadatta is preaching a wrong doctrine. He is preaching a
        wrong discipline. How to Devadatta attempts to bread the unity within the
        Saṅgha?”. Hearing this criticism, friends of Devadatta such as Venerable
        Kokālika tried to prevent monks from accusing Devadatta; “Friends,
        please do not say so. Devadatta is preaching a correct doctrine. He is
        preaching correct discipline. He is acting so also having taken our consent
        and known our desire. We like what he does”. Then other monks who were
        virtuous and liked the unity of the Saṅgha criticized these monks who
        followed Devadatta. Having known the news, the Buddha declared the
        bhedānuvattaka training rule in order to prevent monks from following
        another monk who is attempting a schism with the Saṅgha order. \n \n \n \n

precepts included in the recitation, he makes himself [one] who
cannot be spoken to [saying]: “Venerables, don’t say anything good
or bad to me, and I too shall not say anything good or bad to the
venerables! Venerables, refrain from speaking to me!” [Then] that
bhikkhu should be spoken to thus by the bhikkhus: “Let the venerable one not make himself [one] who cannot be spoken to. Let the
venerable one make himself [one] who can be spoken to. Let the
venerable one speak to the bhikkhus with righteousness and the
monks too will speak to the venerable one with righteousness. For
the Blessed One’s assembly has grown thus, that is, by the speaking
of one to another, by the rehabilitating of one another,” and [if] that
bhikkhu being spoken to thus by the bhikkhus should persist in the
same way [as before], [then] that bhikkhu is to be argued with up to
three times by the bhikkhus for the relinquishing of that [course],
[and if that bhikkhu,] being argued with up to three times, should
relinquish that [course], then this is good, [but] if he should not
relinquish [it], he commits a saṅghādisesa offence.

        Being tenacious (dubbaca) \n \n
When bhikkhus state: “Fellow monk, such acts are unsuitable for bhikkhus.
Refrain from them. Such acts will result in related offences”, and that bhikkhu
responds back stating, “Bhikkhu, you should not offer me advice. I will also not
offer you any advice” etc. indicating his unwillingness to accept advice or
guidance is referred to as being tenacious (dubbaca). It further means that he
considers himself as a person who should not receive any advice. Offering advice
and guidance to such individuals is very difficult. \n \n

        Factors \n \n
Four elements must be fulfilled in order for an offence to be committed when this
training rule is violated. \n
1. The monk stating that he should not be advised \n
2. Performing samanubhāsanakamma in accordance with the Dhamma \n
3. Completing the recitation of the kammavācā thrice \n
4. Not relinquishing one’s own ideas of tenaciousness \n \n

        Once the Buddha was residing at Ghositārāma in Kosmbhi. During that
time, Venerable Channa was conducting misdeeds. Other monks
admonished him not to do so. On receiving admonishments, Venerable
Channa got offended and accused monks stating his relationship with the
Buddha since his youth as the charioteer of the Bodhisattva. He considered
other monks to have ordained from various castes and clans while he was
a close associate of the Buddha even before the Bodhisattva renounced the
household life. Therefore, Venerable Channa considered himself not to be
admonished by other monks. Hearing the arrogant replies of Venerable
Channa, monks were disappointed with him and informed the Buddha of
his bad behavior and arrogance. Hearing the story, the Buddha accused
Venerable Channa, advised him and promulgated the dubbaca training
rule. \n \n \n \n

Now, a bhikkhu lives dependent upon a certain village or town who
is a spoiler of families, who is of bad behaviour. His bad behaviour
is seen and is heard about, and the families spoilt by him are seen
and heard about. That bhikkhu is to be spoken to thus by the
bhikkhus: “The venerable one is a spoiler of families, one who is of
bad behaviour. The bad behaviour of the venerable one is seen and
is heard about, and the families spoilt by the venerable one are seen

        Once the Buddha was residing at the Jetavana monastery in Sāvatthi.
During that time, two monks Venerable Assaji and Punabbasuka were
living in a monastery in the district called Kīṭāgiri. They were having
improper associations with lay devotees and did the acts such as growing
flower trees and so forth. They also acted in ways that are utterly
inappropriate to monks. On another occasion, one virtuous monk after
finishing his rains retreat in the county called Kāsī was on his way to meet
the Buddha and to pay homage. During the journey, he entered the district
called Kīṭāgiri. That monk having dressed nicely, in a morning, went for
alms round in the district of Kīṭāgiri. However, due to frequent association
with monks like Assaji and Punabbasuka lay devotees could not recognize
the value of abiding the Vinaya rules. So, they talked bad about this monk
who was not laughing with them and who was going for alms with eyes
casted down. Instead, the lay devotees praised monks like Assaji and
Punabbasuka who were talkative and greeted lay devotees well whenever
they meet them.
One wise lay devotee saw the monk, approached him and asked,
“Venerable Sir, was it easy for you to find food?”. The monk replied that
it was not easy to obtain food. Then this lay devotee invited the monk to
his house and offered him a meal. He, then, informed all the bad behaviors
of the monks led by Venerable Assaji and Punabbasuka. He also requested
the monk to report the Buddha all what he had said.
After reaching Sāvatthi, the particular monk informed the Buddha about
what he learned from the lay devotee who offered him food. On listening
to this, the Buddha advised Venerable Sāriputta and Moggallāna to go to
Kīṭāgiri and to do a vinayakamma called pabbājanīyakamma to all the
monks led by Venerable Assaji and Punabbasuka. It was an uphill task for
the monks led by two chief disciples to perform the relevant vinayakamma
to the group of monks living in Kīṭāgiri. In the end they managed to do the
pabbājanīyakamma. However, the monks led by Assaji and Punabbasuka
were not happy with the vinayakamma and did not submit to it. They did
not ask for forgiveness, but criticized the monks who did the vinayakamma. When this was informed to the Buddha, declared the
kuladūska training rule prohibiting monks from not submitting to the
pabbājanīyakamma that has been done righteously. \n \n

        <b>Factors</b> \n \n
In order for an offence to be committed under this training rule, the following
four elements must be fulfilled. \n
1. Stating that the bhikkhus who performed the pabbājanīyakamma did so
out of agati \n
2. Righteously conducting the samanubhāsanakamma \n
3. Completing the recitation of the kammavācā thrice \n
4. Not abandoning the idea that the bhikkhus have been affected by agati \n \n

        <b>Kuladūsana</b> \n \n
The Pārājikā Pāḷi indicates that there are eight acts in which corruption of
acquaintances could occur. \n
1. Pupphadāna – Giving flowers to the laity \n
2. Phaladāna – Giving fruits to the laity \n
3. Cuṇṇadāna – Giving concoctions to the laity \n
4. Mattikādāna – Giving clay to the laity \n
5. Dantakaṭṭhadāna – Giving teeth cleaning material to the laity \n
6. Veḷudāna – Giving cane to the laity \n
7. Vejjakamma – Providing medical services for the laity \n
8. Jaṅghapesanikā – Carrying messages of the laity \n
If bhikkhus engage in the above acts in order to treat lay acquaintances, dukkaṭa
offences will be committed. If objects offered to the Saṅgha are given out of
thoughts of one’s own superiority, a tullaccaya offence will be committed. If an
item that belongs to the Saṅgha is given out of stealthy thoughts, it will be deemed
an act of stealing, and the type of offence committed must be determined
according to the value of the item given. \n \n

        <b>Pāpasamācāra</b> \n \n
The Pārājikā Pāḷi also specifies pāpasamācāra. The pāpasamācāra as indicated
under the kuladūsana training rule are as follows. \n
1. Mālāvacchaṃ ropeti, ropāpeti – Planting flowers and getting them
planted \n
2. Mālāvacchaṃ siñcati, siñcāpeti – Watering flower plants and getting
them watered \n
3. Mālāvacchaṃ ocināti, ocināpeti – Plucking flowers and getting them
plucked \n
4. Mālāvacchaṃ gantheti, gnathāpeti – making garlands and getting them
made \n
The acts mentioned above are inappropriate for bhikkhus only in the instance
where they are done to treat lay acquaintances. Engaging in such acts is
condemned by the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and Arahants. It is appropriate to
plant flowers for monastic purposes as per rules of Vinaya. \n \n

        <b>Pabbājanīyakamma</b> \n \n
When a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī constantly engages in acts of kuladūsana as
indicated above, the Buddha has instructed that the pabbājanīyakamma must be
performed on them. If a pabbājanīyakamma is performed on a bhikkhu or
bhikkhunī, he or she must not reside in the monastery staying in which he engaged
on those acts. Moreover, he or she must not go on begging for alms rounds in that
village of which the correct faith of devotees was destroyed. In the instance of
residing in the same monastery after the pabbājanīyakamma, he or she must not
even go on begging rounds in the village nearby. Even though residing in a nearby
monastery is possible, in the instance of residing in a nearby monastery, he must
not go on piṇḍapāta in the same village. While residing in a nearby monastery, it
is possible to go on begging rounds in the nearby village.
In addition, a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who has undergone the pabbājanīyakamma
must follow certain Vinaya practices. \n \n

        <b>Samanubhāsanakamma</b> \n \n
A bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who has undergone the pabbājanīyakamma due to acts
of destroying the correct faith of devotees, must conform to that correct
vinayakamma. However, sometimes, defensive bhikkhus or bhikkhunīs who
oppose the vinayakamma may not conform to it in the appropriate manner by
accusing the Saṅgha who performed the vinayakamma that the formal
disciplinary act was performed out of desire (chanda), anger (dosa), fear (bhaya)
and ignorance (moha) in a prejudiced manner.The Buddha preached that the
samanubhāsanakamma should be performed for such bhikkhus in such instances.
Bhikkhus or bhikkhunī who have undergone the pabbājanīyakamma, still do not
conform to it, the other bhikkhus must offer advice to them to make them abandon
their ideas. It is great if such ideas are dispelled, when advice is given. If not,
samanubhāsanakamma must be performed. It is great if such ideas are dispelled
during the performance of the samanubhāsanakamma. However, if not, by the
end of the samanubhāsanakamma, the particular bhikkhu or bhikkhunī will have
committed a saṅghādisesa offence. \n \n
A saṅghādisesa offence will be committed when a bhikkhu who has undergone
the pabbājanīyakamma, does not agree or adapt to it and accuses stating “The
bhikkhus who performed the vinayakamma are affected by the four types of
agati” etc. and does not abandon his ideas even while the samanubhāsanakamma
is being done on him. The saṅghādisesa offence is not committed due to the acts
of kuladūsana and pāpasamācāra. Each act of kuladūsana and pāpasamācāra
entails a dukkaṭa offence only. \n \n \n \n \n
