    <string name="textDescribeEtichVeriabUniversal">
        UNIVERSAL MENTAL FACTORS (sabbacittasādhārana): \n\n
         The seven universal mental factors are common (sādharan a) to all consciousnesses (sabbacitta) cetasikas.
         These factors perform the most rudimentary and basic cognitive functions,
         without which awareness of the object would be completely impossible. \n\n
    </string>
    <string name="textDescribeEtichVeriabSometime">
    OCCASIONAL MENTAL FACTORS (pakiṇṇaka): \n\n
    The six cetasikas in this group are similar to the universals in that
    they are ethically variable factors which take on the moral quality of the citta, determined by other
    accompanying factors. They differ from the universal mental factors, however,
    in that they are found only in some types of consciousness, not in all. \n\n
