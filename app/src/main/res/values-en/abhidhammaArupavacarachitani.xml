    <string name="textDiscribeArupavacharachitani">FORMLESS SPHERE CONSCIOUSNESS (arūpāvacaracittāni):
    This sphere of consciousness comprises the cittas pertaining to the immaterial plane of existence (arūpabhūmi),
    four planes in which matter has been completely transcended and only consciousness and mental factors remain.
    Rebirth into these four planes occurs through the attainment of the arūpajjhānas, the four immaterial, or
    formless, absorptions, which are achieved by developing concentration beyond the five jhānas of the fine-material sphere.
    The formless sphere consists of twelve cittas: four wholesome cittas, with which laypeople and practitioners
    [in the initial stages of Enlightenment] experience the immaterial attainments; four resultant,
    which arise through rebirth in the immaterial planes; and four functional,
    which arise in Arahants who undertake the immaterial attainments.

    The Sphere of Infinite Space (ākāsānañcāyatana):
    The first of the four immaterial jhānas is the attainment of the sphere of infinite space. To achieve it, a meditator who has mastered the fifth fine-material jhāna, based on a kasiṇa object, extends the kasiṇa’s counterpart sign to immeasurable dimensions.
        Then, they remove the kasiṇa, attending only to the space it pervaded, contemplating it as “infinite space.”
        Continuing to attend in this way, at a certain point in immersion, a citta arises having as its object the concept of infinite
        space (ākāsapaññatti). The expression “sphere of infinite space,” strictly speaking, refers to the concept
of infinite space, which serves as the object of the first consciousness of the immaterial sphere. Here the word āyatana,
“sphere,” has the meaning of a habitat or dwelling place for the citta of this jhāna. However, in a derivative sense,
the expression “sphere of infinite space” also extends to the jhāna itself.
