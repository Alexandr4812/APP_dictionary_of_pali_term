    <string name="text_for_kontakt"><b>CONTACT (phassa):</b> The word phassa comes from the verb
phusati, meaning "to touch", but contact should not
be understood as a simple physical effect of an object on
the physical ability [touch]. Rather, it
is a mental factor through which consciousness mentally "touches"
an object that has just appeared, thereby initiating
a whole cognitive event.</string>

    <string name="text_for_kontakt_harakteristika"><b>CHARACTERISTIC:</b> touch</string>
    <string name="text_for_kontakt_function"><b>FUNCTION:</b> the collision of consciousness and object.</string>
    <string name="text_for_kontakt_proyavlenie"><b>MANIFESTATION:</b> the coincidence of consciousness with sensory ability.</string>
    <string name="text_for_kontakt_prichina"><b>THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE:</b> the object field that has come into focus.</string>

    <string name="button_chuvstvo">2 \nfeeling \n(vedana)</string>

    <string name="text_for_chuvstvo">FEELING (vedana): Feeling is the mental factor
that the object feels, it is the emotional tone
in which the object is experienced. The Pali word Vedana
does not mean emotion (which is a complex phenomenon
involving a set of accompanying mental factors),
it is the most elementary emotional quality of experience, which
can be pleasant, painful or neutral. \n While other mental factors
outlive the object only indirectly, the feeling experiences it
directly and completely. In this regard, other mental factors
they are compared to the cook who prepares a dish for the king
and only tastes it during cooking, while the
feeling is compared to the king himself, who enjoys
this food as much as he wants.</string>

    <string name="text_for_chuvstvo_harakteristika">CHARACTERISTIC: Sensitivity</string>
    <string name="text_for_chuvstvo_function">FUNCTION: experiencing, or enjoying the desired object directly.</string>

    <string name="button_vospriyatie">3 \nPerception \n(saňňā)</string>

    <string name="text_for_vospriyatie">PERCEPTION (saññā): His mode of action is comparable
to the carpenterёs recognition of certain types of wood by means of marks placed [earlier] on each of them.</string>

    <string name="text_for_vospriyatie_harakteristika">CHARACTERISTIC: distinguishing the qualities of an object.</string>
    <string name="text_for_vospriyatie_function">FUNCTION: recognition of what was perceived earlier.</string>
    <string name="text_for_vospriyatie_proyavlenie">MANIFESTATION: interpretation of an object through previously perceived features.</string>
    <string name="text_for_vospriyatie_prichina">IMMEDIATE CAUSE: the object as it appears to perception.</string>

    <string name="button_volenie">4 \nVolition \n(chetanā)</string>

    <string name="text_for_volenie">WOLITION (chetanā): Chetanā - from the same root as
and citta, is a mental factor that deals with the actualization of the goal, that is, with the voluntary or
volitional aspect of cognition. Therefore it is translated as “will.” The comments explain
that chetana organizes the associated mental factors in the process of their influence on the object.
         As the main student repeats
your own lesson and also forces other students
repeat their lessons, and the will, starting to work in relation to its object, also forces the associated
mental states to perform their own tasks.
Volition is the most important mental factor in the generation of kamma, since it is volition that determines
ethical quality of action.</string>

mind on the object. Although this factor reaches its expressiveness only in the jhanas, where it functions as a factor
jhānas, the Abhidhamma teaches that the germ of this ability
to mental unification is present in all types of consciousness, even the most rudimentary.
In them it functions as the factor which fixes the mind on the object. </string>

the factor responsible for directing the mind towards an object, whereby the object becomes presented to the consciousness.
     Attention - how
the ship`s rudder, which guides it to its destination,
or like a charioteer who sends well-trained
horses (i.e. associated states) towards their destination (object). Mental factor
manasikāra must be distinguished from vitakka: at that time
how manasikāra directs the accompanying mental
factors to an object, Vittaka applies them to the object. Manasikāra is an obligatory cognitive factor,
         present in all states of consciousness; vitakka - special
alised factor that is not mandatory for
process of cognition.</string>
