Rising early in the morning, taking off his sandals, putting his outer robe over his shoulder, the student should
Prepare the mentor with wood sticks for brushing teeth and water for rinsing the mouth washing the face. [Comment: you should bring three dental sticks: small, medium and large; as well as cold and hot water for rinsing the mouth and for bathing. What kind of mentor will this make?
use for three days, should be brought regularly from now on. If he uses it without special preference, then you should bring him what is available. (The commentary here means by "preparing" only the display of these things in the right place for this purpose, and not in
direct transfer of these to the mentor. Once this has been done, you should begin sweeping the restroom and surrounding area while the mentor brushes his teeth and washes his face. Then, while the mentor is still busy with his morning shower, he should proceed to the next step). \n \n

We need to prepare the seat. If there is drinking porridge, then after washing a shallow bowl, you need to offer it to the mentor. When the mentor drank the porridge, then, giving him water, taking a bowl,
holding it down (so as not to wet the clothes), you need to wash the bowl thoroughly, but do not scrape it Comm.: hitting it on the floor, and then put it in its place. When the mentor gets up, you need to remove his seat, and if the area is dirty, sweep it up. \n \n

If the mentor wishes to go to the village for alms, give him his undergarment, taking his spare one (which he is currently wearing). (This is one of several passages that show that at the time the canon was compiled it was already the practice to have spare vestments). Give him his belt, outer robe and outer cloak sangati; bhikkhus have 3 robes,
the last of which is the cloak, which you need to put on before going out into the populated area, folding them in a straight line. After rinsing his cup, give it to him while it is still wet. \n \n

If the mentor wants an assistant *when going for alms, then, putting on your robes (see sekkhiya), putting on the belt, washing and taking the cup, help the mentor. Don`t go too far
behind him, and don`t walk too close. Comment: one or two steps will be just right. Take the contents of the mentor`s cup. Comment: if the mentor`s cup is heavy or too hot for
in order to hold it, then take his cup and give yours (which, most likely, will be lighter and not so hot). (In the Sangha, where, during begging, cups are carried in covers -
carriers, the student can simply pick up the mentor`s cup). \n \n

Do not interrupt the mentor when he speaks. If he is one step away from committing a crime, then he should be stopped.
Comment: you should speak in an indirect manner, with hints, to bring him to his senses. Sub-comm.: contrary to the fact that protocols to a mentor may not be fulfilled due to illness, this particular point should always be fulfilled. \n \n

When returning before the mentor, you should prepare the seat. Set out the water to wash your feet,
a footrest and a stone for wiping your feet. Then go meet him; when you meet him, take his cup. Give him a spare undergarment, take away the one he is currently wearing. If the outer garment and outer cloak of the mentor are wet from perspiration, then they should be dried on
sun, but don`t keep them there for too long. Fold the garments Sub-com: separately so that they do not wrinkle. (This, as Vinaya-mukha notes, helps extend the life of the fabric.) Fold
    belt for robes. (From these phrases it is clear that in those days, bhikkhus walked in their abodes only in their lower robe, even when eating). \n \n
`If you managed to get alms and the mentor wants to eat, then prepare food for him and give him water to wash the bowl. Ask if he needs drinking water. [Comment: if there is enough time before lunch, you should wait next to the mentor until he eats, then offer him
drinking water, and only then eat it yourself. If there is not enough time, then you should simply put out drinking water and start eating.] \n \n
`When he has finished eating, then, after giving him water, take his cup, lower it lower, and then wash it carefully, but do not scrape it. Then, having dried the bowl, place it in the sun for a short time, but not for long. \n \n

`Put his cup and robes back in their place of storage. When cleaning, you should take the bowl in one hand, and with the other hand, check under the bed (if there is anything there that will harm the bowl), and then put the bowl itself there. But you should not place it on bare ground *Comm.: any place where it
will become dirty.] When putting away the clothes, you need to take them in one hand, and run the other along the pole or clothes line *Comment: to check if there are any notches that can catch and tear the fabric], after checking, you need to throw the clothes over the pole or rope so that the edges are away from you and the fold is towards you. *Comment: the fold of fabric should not be directed towards the wall, because if there is
serif, then you can tear the robe in the middle.] \n \n

`When the mentor stands up, remove his seat. Remove the foot wash water, foot rest and foot stone. If it`s dirty, sweep it up. \n \n
`If the mentor wants to swim, prepare a swimming place. If he wants to bathe in cold water, prepare cold water; if he wants to bathe in hot water, prepare hot water. \n \n

`If the mentor wants to visit the bathhouse, mix the bathing powder, moisten the bathing clay, take the bathhouse bench and follow the mentor. Having given him a bench, take away his clothes, and
put it aside [Comm: where there is no soot and smoke.] Give him the powder or clay. If you can, also go to the bathhouse. When entering, you should smear your face with clay and cover yourself in front and behind (in
"three circles" [see sekhiya 1] there is no need to wrap yourself up). \n \n

`Sit so as not to crowd the elders and not to infringe upon the younger ones. Help a mentor *Comm:
light the fire, provide him with hot water and clay]. When leaving the bathhouse, cover yourself in front and
behind, take the bench. Help the mentor also in the subsequent bathing. After taking a swim,
The student should come out of the water first, dry himself and put on his underwear. Then he should wipe the water from the mentor and give him his lower and upper garments. \n \n
`When taking the bath bench, the student should return first, prepare the seat, prepare water for washing feet, a footrest and a stone for wiping feet. (When the mentor has sat down,) ask him if he wants something to drink. \n \n

`If the mentor wishes to recite *Comm: memorize passages from the Dhamma or Vinaya], then
should be recited. If he wants to ask you *Comm: about the meaning of these passages], then you should answer the questions. \n \n
`If the mentor`s place of residence is dirty, then, if the student is capable, he needs to clean it. You need to take out his bowl, robes, sitting cloth, sheet, pillow and mattress. Need to
    carefully remove the bed without scraping [Comm.: on the floor], and without hitting it against the door. Take it out
a spittoon... a board for leaning on... Having noted where the floor covering is located, it also needs to be removed. \n \n
`If there are cobwebs in your home, then they need to be removed, starting from the ceiling. Window frames and surrounding areas, as well as corners (of rooms), should be wiped. If the walls are decorated with ocher and there appears
mold, then you need to wet a rag and wipe it off. If the floor is laid out, it needs to be washed. If the floor is bare earth, then you need to sweep it, first moistening it with water: “Let its dust rise and not
will dirty the room." Any rubbish must be taken out. \n \n

`After drying the floor covering in the sun, you need to clean it and knock it out of dust, and then lay it down as it was laid before. After drying and cleaning the bed supports, you need to bring them back and
put them where they were. After drying the bed... bench... mattress... pillow... seat fabric... spittoon... leaning board... carefully bring it in. \n \n
`If dusty winds blow from any direction, then you need to close the windows on that side. If
The weather is cold, then the windows need to be opened during the day and closed at night. If the weather is hot, then the windows should be closed during the day and opened at night. \n \n
`If the surrounding area is dirty, you need to sweep it. If the porch... meeting room... fireplace... toilet is dirty, then you need to clean, sweep. If water for washing (feet) or water for drinking is not set, then it needs to be set. If there is no water in the toilet for flushing, then it
needs to be exposed. \n \n

`If the mentor has any dissatisfaction with the life of purity, then it should be dispelled, or someone who will be able to do this should be found, or a conversation should be held about the Dhamma. If the mentor has any concerns (regarding his adherence to the training rules), then he
it must be dispelled, or someone who can do it must be found, or a conversation about the Dhamma must be had. If the mentor has a view (diṭṭhigata: a strong view regarding a matter about which one should not expand [see MN 72], or a completely false view [see eg MN 22].), then it must be dispelled, or one must be found who will be able to do this, or should a conversation about the Dhamma be held. \n \n

`If the mentor has committed a serious offense (saṅghādisesa) and deserves appropriate
disciplinary action (temporary suspension), then the student should make an effort: “How would the Community impose disciplinary action on my mentor?” \n \n

`If the Community wants to hold a meeting against the mentor (criticism, expulsion [from a certain monastery], suspension, etc.), then the student should make an effort: “How could the Community not make such a decision, or how can I soften its decision?” . If a certain decision is made against him, then the student should make an effort: “How can I make my mentor behave appropriately and correct himself, so that the Community withdraws its decision?” \n \n

`If the mentor`s robes need to be washed, then the disciple should wash it, or make an effort: “How can I make sure that my mentor`s robes are washed?” If a mentor needs to cut robes... If he needs to brew dye... If a mentor needs to dye robes... When dyeing a mentor`s robes, you need to do it consistently and carefully. \n \n
`Without the permission of the mentor, the disciple should not give his begging bowl to anyone [Comm: who is on bad terms with the mentor], and should not receive his bowl from such a person. Not
    one should give cloth for robes... Monastic necessities... One should not cut his hair... One should not look after him... One should not bring back alms to him... \n \n
`Without the permission of the mentor, the student should not go into the city, cemetery (for meditation), or leave the area. \n \n
`If the mentor is sick, then the student should take care of him while he is alive; he should remain with him until he is restored. \n \n \n \n</string>

`The student should be helped with recitation, questioning, exhortation and instruction. If the mentor has a cup, but the student does not, then the first should provide the second with one, or make an effort: “How would my student receive the cup?” If the mentor has fabric for robes… a monastic necessity... \n \n

`If the student is sick, then the mentor should (fulfill his own obligations in relation to him: from morning procedures and right up to cleaning his home; but the mentor does not need to take off his sandals and put on clothes in a certain way, he does not need to help the student when walking for
alms, and there is no prohibition to interrupt). \n \n

`If a student has dissatisfaction with life in purity, then it should be dispelled, or someone who will be able to do this should be found, or a conversation should be held about the Dhamma. If
the student has anxiety (regarding his adherence to the rules of training), then she
it must be dispelled, or someone who can do it must be found, or a conversation about the Dhamma must be had. If a student has a view (diṭṭhigata: a strong view regarding a matter about which one should not expand *see MN 72+, or a completely false view *see e.g. MN 22+.), then it must be dispelled, or one must be found who will be able to do this, or should a conversation about the Dhamma be held. \n \n

`If the mentor has committed a serious offense (saṅghādisesa) ... [for bhikkhus only] \n \n

`If a student is sick, then the mentor should take care of him while he is alive; he should remain with him until he is restored. \n \n

Is it permissible to follow what has become customary? What is the permission regarding what has become customary? \n \n
`Thinking: “This is the custom of my mentor, this is the custom of my teacher,” it is permissible to act accordingly. But this is allowed in some cases, but not in others. \n \n \n \n</string>
